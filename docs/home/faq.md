# FAQs  

**How can I try out Esper?**

Sign up for the free Esper Trial! Create an endpoint for your company to run all of your Esper services, and get access to the Esper Console. Developers can generate API keys and use them with the APIs, SDK, CLI, and Android Tools.
 
**How long does the Esper Trial last?**

The Esper Trial lasts for 6 months after your endpoint is created, and is intended for development and evaluation use - not for commercial deployments. Contact Esper if you have any further questions about the Trial, we’d be happy to help.
 
**Can I invite other members of my team to use the Esper Trial?**
Yes! If you have created an Esper Trial Endpoint you can simply add additional users in the User Management section. Each user has access to all the templates created for the endpoint and all the devices provisioned through the Endpoint. Additionally each user can create their own set of API Keys, noting all users of the Endpoint will have the same Enterprise ID
 
**If I like Esper, can I convert my Trial Endpoint to use ongoing or do I need to start with a new Endpoint?**

You can continue to use your same endpoint if you decide to adopt Esper. And we hope you do end up liking Esper!
 
**Can I change the name of the Trial Endpoint as I did not use my company’s name?**

Unfortunately once the endpoint name is chosen, it can’t be changed. But let us know and we’ll figure something out.
 
**Do I have to be a developer to use Esper?**

No, Esper has a full Console with a Dashboard available for non-developer users. It provides the full capabilities of Esper in a convenient to use Web Portal. Create templates, provision and manage devices, set alerts, monitor your fleet - it's all there for you and your team.
 
**Do I need to use the Esper Console to use Esper?**

No, Esper has a rich set of APIs that can be called directly via REST/HTTP, via our SDK for Python, or using our CLI. Additionally we have a set of tools for Android Studio, including an app uploader that lets you upload your APKs directly from Android Studio to Esper. There are a few actions that currently can only be done through the Console, like creating Device Templates. Over time we’ll increasingly add capabilities to the API moving beyond the Console.
 
**Does Esper support Kiosk mode?**

Yes, Esper supports a locked-down Kiosk mode applicable for many usage scenarios beyond Kiosk in restaurants, POS, and delivery. It is easily set up through the Esper Console or using our APIs.
 
**What provisioning means does Esper support?**

Esper supports multiple provisioning methods. Developers find ADB to be most convenient, but field-based provisioning can be accomplished using the system generated QR codes. For large numbers of devices, Esper provides provisioning using IMEI or serial numbers - combined with Esper Enhanced Android customers can apply Zero touch enrollment for their device fleet. Android for Work (AfW) is also available as an additional option. Note the Android version you run impacts both the availability and the method you need to follow to provision, this is one reason why we set our minimum Android OS at Nougat/7.0.
 
**What is Esper Enhanced Android? Do I need to have it on my device to use Esper?**

Esper Enhanced Android is a hardened version built and maintained by Esper specifically for use on dedicated devices. With Esper Enhanced Android customers receive the benefit of Zero touch enrollment and secure remote diagnostics of deployed devices running in the field including debugging, profiling, and viewing. You do NOT need it to use Esper Enhanced Android in order to use Esper. Esper works with “stock” Android, however, you do not receive the additional features enabled by Esper Enhanced Android. Esper Enhanced Android is available for select devices, please contact us in you’d like to find out more.
 
**What Android releases are supported by Esper?**

To obtain the set of Esper features, we require Android Nougat/7.0 or above. If you are running an older version, contact us so we can discuss the available feature set.
 
**Is Esper an MDM system?**

Esper’s roots are in MDM, but typical MDM doesn’t deliver everything needed across the lifecycle of apps running on dedicated devices. Developers play a lead role for these solutions, yet incumbents provide very little by way of tools and enablement. MDM doesn’t fit the bill - instead we will deliver on our vision of Device Orchestration.
 
**How does Esper compare to available MDM, EMM, or UEM solutions?**

We are the only company providing Device Orchestration and we do it just for Android-based dedicated devices spanning developers and admins by providing a full API set, an SDK, a CLI, tools for Android Studio, and a web-based Console. No other vendor does this.
 
**How much does Esper cost?**

Esper has several pricing models and tiers available, either purely per device or a blend of device and consumption. Contact us to find out more.
 
**Do you support Zero touch enrollment?**

Yes! By using Esper Enhanced Android you can perform scaled Zero touch enrollment using Esper across your entire device fleet.
 
**What is Device Orchestration?**

Device Orchestration is moving beyond MDM to bring the management of dedicated devices into DevOps. MDM is the antiquated approach to device management established in a pre-cloud computing world. Additionally, MDM does not factor in building and maintaining dedicated device fleets - it appeared to service BYOD. Esper was conceived for the DevOps world with CI/CD - we expose the Esper platform via a set of APIs that can be integrated into Cloud-based backend systems for automating the device management process, hence orchestrating. We also robustly address the app developers’ needs to work with dedicated devices during the early phases of app development and testing using our Android Tools, the SDK, and the CLI.
 
Where is Esper based?
We are based in Seattle with offices in Silicon Valley. We are ex-Amazon and Microsoft with deep experience in Android, Windows CE, and Windows Phone.
 
What does Esper offer for customer support?
We provide free support within reason during the Trial period. After or beyond that we provide paid support plans with the choice of email, telephone, chat, or Zoom.
 
Does Esper support iOS devices and/or PC-based systems?
No, we do not. We are not a general device management company. We are hyper-focused on Android-based dedicated devices. That’s what we do!
 
Does Esper support BYOD?
We do not support BYOD scenarios. We do support bringing your own dedicated devices.
