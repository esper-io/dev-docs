# Esper console

The Esper console is a feature-rich user interface for you to operate and manage your fleet of Android devices. Esper provides a range of super simple options to deploy company‑owned devices at scale.

## Static Interface Elements

### Navigation Bar

No matter where you are in the Esper Console, there will be a navigation bar along the left side of the screen. This enables you to quickly navigate to each of the other sections of the Esper Console. These sections are:

   - Dashboard
   - Provisioning Methods
   - Provisioning Templates
   - Devices
   - Groups
   - Apps
   - Alerts
   - Compliance Policy
   - Reports
   - Geofence
   - Pipeline
   - Company Settings
   - Esper Enhanced Updates
   - API Key Management

You can hide the names in the navigation bar to show just icons by clicking on the chevron at the top. Click on the chevron again to slide the navigation bar back out to show the names.

### Feedback Widget

No matter where you are in the Console, the blue Feedback button at the bottom right corner of the Console will allow you to share detailed feedback and report issues without leaving the screen.
![Feedback](./assets/NewConsole/Feedback.png)

Clicking **Feedback** brings up a screen with the following tools:

   - Box tool – Highlight a specific area of the page and comment on that area. If you prefer, don’t enter a comment; simply leave the box outline.
   - Blackout tool – Blackout any sensitive information on the screen.
   - Pen tool – Draw anything you like! Circle and Point works great with a touch screen and pen.
   - Line tool – Underline, strikethrough, draw a straight line.
   - Line with arrow tool – Point to something.
   - Comment tool – Drop a pin and make a comment.
   
![Feedback Tools](./assets/NewConsole/FeedbackTools.png)

When you’re ready to submit your feedback, click the check-mark to the right of the toolbar. This will bring up a pop-up box that will enable you to select a feedback category and fill in your comments. To submit your feedback or comment, click Send. Your feedback will go directly directly to Esper’s engineering team, who will then add it to our feature and issue tracking system.

![Feedback Type](./assets/NewConsole/FeedbackType.png)

### What’s New Button

At the top right of the screen is the **What’s New** button.

![What's New](./assets/NewConsole/WhatsNew.png)

When you click it a panel will slide in from the right side of the screen; scroll through it to learn more about updates and improvements to your Esper experience.

![WhatsNew](./assets/NewConsole/WhatsNewContent.png)

### Toast Notifications

Most notifications on your Esper console will appear as toast notifications at the bottom left corner of your screen. These notifications disappear after a few seconds; if you prefer, you can click on the X to dismiss them. If there are multiple notifications queued, click the X of the topmost notification to get to the next one in the queue.
![Toast](./assets/NewConsole/Toast.png)

These types of notifications are called "toast notifications" because they pop up like toast from a toaster.

### Informational Slider Screen and Dropdowns

Many actions in the Esper console can be carried out on multiple devices across a wide variety of situations. Some devices may be offline or have poor internet connectivity. When these types of action are taken, a status screen will slide out from the right side of the console, showing the status of the action on each of the devices on which it is being executed.

You will encounter these slider screens frequently as you use your Esper console.
![Info Slider](./assets/NewConsole/InfoSlider.png)
 
Some operations—such as installing a new version of your app after hours across thousands of devices—can be performed over hours or days. Fortunately, you don’t need to watch the status reported on the informational slide out screen the whole time. To force an update to the overall status displayed in the slider, click the refresh button in the upper right hand corner. To exit a slider, click the X next to the refresh button. You return to the slider by clicking on the link or button associated with that action. 
![Close Slider](./assets/NewConsole/SliderClose.png)

For certain operations performed on a set of devices in a group, a popdown will appear on the screen. This gives you a quick summary of the top level status, with an option to open up the accompanying detailed slider screen.
![Wipe](./assets/NewConsole/Wipe.png)

### Logging Out

To log out of the Console, click on the user icon at the top-right corner of the screen and select Log Out from the drop down menu.

![Logging out](./assets/NewConsole/Logout.png)
   
### Users

Esper’s user management functions can be reached by clicking on the user icon at the top-right of the screen, then selecting **User Management** from the dropdown menu.

![User management](./assets/NewConsole/UserManagement.png)

Access to this page is only available to those with Enterprise Admin roles, those with other roles will not see the User management option in the drop down. Click on **User Management**.

![User summary](./assets/NewConsole/UsersSummary.png)

There are four main roles for Esper Console users: *Enterprise Administrator, Enterprise Viewer, Group Administrator*, and *Group Viewer*. Each role has different permissions, ranging from an Enterprise Administrator, who is able to view or change anything, down to a Group Viewer, who can view those things having to do with those groups to which the Group Viewer is assigned.
The privileges and permissions for each role are as follows:
![Group Roles](./assets/NewConsole/GroupRole.png)
![Group Role](./assets/NewConsole/GroupRoleCtd.png)

### Adding a New User

To add a new user, click on New User
![New User](./assets/NewConsole/UserNew.png)

Enter the new user’s name, username, email, and password. Re-enter the password and click **Next**.
![Create User](./assets/NewConsole/UserCreate.jpg)

Select the new user’s role from the dropdown menu.
![User Role](./assets/NewConsole/UserRole.jpg)

If you’re creating a Group Admin or Group Viewer, assign to the appropriate groups and click **Confirm**.
![Add GroupUser](./assets/NewConsole/UserAddGroup.jpg)

After adding a user, be sure to give the user their login credentials so that they can log in.

### Editing a User

The User Management screen also enables you to edit the details of a user. To do so, click on the pencil icon in line with that user’s listing.
![Edit User](./assets/NewConsole/UserEdit.png)

You will be able to change the username, email, full name, password, and role assigned to the user. If you do that, be sure to pass the changes on to the account owner so they can continue to access the Esper console.

### Deleting a User

To delete a user from the enterprise, click on the trash can icon in line with that user’s listing. That user will no longer be able to access their account:
![Delete User](./assets/NewConsole/UserDelete.png)

## Dashboard

When you enter the Esper Console, the first page you encounter is the Dashboard. It acts as the homepage for the console and provides useful, at-a-glance information about the status of your Android fleet.

![Esper console](./assets/NewConsole/Dashboard.png)


The first time you log in to a newly created Esper console, you’ll see a default screen indicating you do not have any devices enrolled and offering the option to create a cloud-based simulated Android device, called a Simulare:

![Esper console](./assets/NewConsole/DashboardInitial.png) 

If you’d like to simulate an Android device, click Simulare Device. You will see a momentary "You are all set!" message after which a mock device will be available for you to experiment with and learn on until you’re ready to provision an actual device.

Capabilities such as Apps, Remote View and Capture log may not be available on a Simulated device.

NOTE: This feature is only available on accounts created after Friday, September 27, 2019. If you became an Esper client before then and would like access to a simulated device, contact us.

Once you enroll and provision your first device, this screen changes to the full Dashboard view.

### Status Panels

The main body of the Dashboard contains four status panels:

#### 1\. Deployment Status

The Deployment status panel shows the current deployment status of all your devices, with the number of devices in each of four possible statuses: online devices, offline devices, under provisioning, and recently added. Clicking one of these statuses will take you to the [Device Dashboard](./console.md#devices) section, filtered to show the devices currently in that status.

#### 2\. Security summary

The Security summary panel provides a snapshot of security status of all your deployed devices, with the number of devices in each of four possible statues: high risk, medium risk, low risk, or no risk. Clicking on one of these statuses will take you to the [Device Dashboard](./console.md#devices) section, filtered to show you the devices in the risk category indicated.

#### 3\. Where are your devices?

The Where are your devices? panel shows the physical location reported by each of your devices on a map. Immediately below the map is a summary of cities worldwide containing the highest number of devices.

#### 4\.Alerts status

The Alerts status panel provides a summary of alerts you’ve created and the number of times each has fired. You can see the number of alerts fired by selecting that alert from the dropdown menu.

## Provisioning methods

Provisioning is the initial step of enrolling, configuring, and managing an Android device using the Esper platform and associated developer tools.
Esper provides several different methods for provisioning Android devices, depending on the capabilities of the device being configured:
   Android for Work, part of Android for Enterprise
   6-Tap QR Code, part of Android for Enterprise
   The Provisioner Tool
   Seamless Provisioning
Additional provisioning methods may be available including Google Zero-Touch Enrollment, Samsung Knox Mobile Enrollment, IMEI/Serial Number-based, NFC-based, and in some specific cases using a downloaded APK. Please contact Esper directly to find out if your account qualifies and your device is supported.
![Provisioning](./assets/NewConsole/ProvisioningMethods.png)

If you meet the prerequisites, you may provision your device using any of the above methods. To select one of the provisioning methods, or to see detailed steps for that method, hold your mouse over it and the Provision button will appear. Click on the Provision button and detailed steps for the selected method will appear.

![Provisioning](./assets/NewConsole/ProvisionAFW.png)

### Selecting a Provisioning Method

Each of the four provisioning methods is suited to different situations. Click the name of a method to get specific instructions. All methods require Internet connectivity.

1.  [AfW provisioning](./console/device-provisioning/afw-provisioning/index.md) 
    The AfW method is best used for:
      - Devices that have GMS (Google Mobile Services) support enabled
      - Devices with a camera for QR code scanning
      - Android 6.0 and above
      - Factory reset of device required
   You can also use IMEI / Serial Numbers with the AfW provisioning method on some devices. This is useful when shipping a device directly to a customer so they can provision it themselves, for devices without a camera, and it prevents repurposing the device by exploiting factory reset. It requires a passcode, which is the same as the password used by the Esper Settings app set up in the Compliance Policy. See the **Upload IMEI CSV** section below for more information on how to load IMEIs and Serial Numbers into a template.

2.  [6-Tap QR Code Provisioning](./console/device-provisioning/qr-code-provisioning/index.md)
       6-Tap QR code provisioning is best used for:
      - Devices that have Google Mobile Services (GMS) support enabled
      - Devices with a camera for QR code scanning
      - Android 7.0 and above
      - Factory reset of device required
   Beginning with Android 9 you can include credentials for the Wi-Fi network to be used for provisioning in your template. They’ll be included in the QR code, eliminating the need to enter them on the device to establish the required Internet connectivity.

3.  [Provisioner Tool](./console/device-provisioning/adb-provisioning/index.md) 
      The Provisioner Tool is a user-friendly provisioning tool by Esper that runs on Mac and Windows. You can conveniently use this to provision:
      - All Android Devices—GMS and most Non-GMS—running Android 4.4 or newer
      - Devices with or without camera
      - Multiple devices at once
      - Android Studio AVDs for development and test purposes
   You’ll need a USB cable to connect the device to the computer you’re using for provisioning. There is an Ethernet-based approach you can use if the device is on the same subnet as the computer running the Provisioner Tool.
Requires you on the device to turn on Developer Options and enable USB Debugging.

The Provisioner Tool does not support Google Single Sign-on (SSO). If you set up your Esper Console login using Google SSO, simply go to your account on the Esper Console, enter in a password, and save it—you will no longer be using Google SSO and can now sign in on the Provisioner Tool and continue to use the login method on the Esper Console.


4.  [Seamless provisioning](./console/device-provisioning/imei-or-serial-number-based-provisioning/index.md)
      Seamless provisioning is only for devices running Esper Enhanced Android:
      - IMEI/Serial Number method is use for bulk provisioning of devices
      - Enables true no-touch provisioning using a predetermined Wi-Fi access point
     
    Contact Esper to find out more about Esper Enhanced Android and Seamless Provisioning.

    :::tip
    In case a device gets stuck during provisioning, we have introduced a cheat way to skip out of it. Tap 7 times on Esper logo on provision screen to show reset button if this action needs to be performed during the provisioning process.
    :::

### Need Help Choosing?

If you find choosing between these methods confusing, we have provided an easy way to find the best provisioning method: Fill the form on the right side. You’ll need to provide the following information:
   - **Android version** — Check the android version on your device by navigating to Settings > About >  Android Version. Choose the correct version of Android for your device from the dropdown menu.
   - **Esper Enhanced** — Esper Enhanced Android is purpose-built Android OS, optimized for deployment under the Esper system. Esper provides Esper Enhanced devices on request from customers. Click YES, if your devices are Esper Enhanced.
   - **GMS support** — Click YES, if your Android device supports Google Mobile Services. If the Play Store app is included on your device, your device is likely a GMS device.
   - **Camera** —  Choose YES, if your device has a working camera.
Then click Suggest Provisioning Method. 

Based on your selections, the tool will suggest one of the four provisioning methods by highlighting it. Click on it to see the steps to provision your device.
If you still have trouble figuring the provisioning process, Esper support will be happy to assist you. Send an email to support@esper.io.

:::tip
In case a device stalls during provisioning, there’s a way to exit out and factory reset the device. On any provisioning screen showing the Esper logo, tap the logo seven times; this will bring up the Factory Reset button. Simply touch the button to start the reset process.
:::

![Factory Reset](./assets/NewConsole/DeviceFactoryReset.jpg)

## Provisioning Templates

Provisioning Templates give you a straightforward way to enroll and provision multiple devices. You create templates for devices in which you specify the compliance policy, apps, device settings, device group—even the wallpapers—you want to be provisioned on your devices.
The Provisioning Templates are shown as tiles with the most-recently created at the top. You can easily find templates by name using the **Search Templates** feature:
![Template View](./assets/NewConsole/TemplateView.png)
   
You can easily open up the QR code to use during AfW or 6-Tap QR Code provisioning by clicking on **View QR Code**. 
Be careful sharing the QR code as in some cases Wi-Fi access point credentials are included, and anyone with it can enroll a supported Android device into your fleet. For those cases where distributing a QR code outside of your organization would be required, instead consider using AfW IMEI/Serial Number provisioning with a passcode.

### Actions on Template Tiles

Clicking on the ellipses (...) at the top right of one of the template tiles opens a pop-up menu that enables you to do the following to that template:
   - Preview
   - Edit
   - Duplicate
   - Upload IMEI CSV
   - Download Config
   - Delete
   
![Template Actions](./assets/NewConsole/TemplateEllipsis.png)

**Preview**
Click Preview to preview the Provisioning Template. Click on the + sign to expand each section. 
NOTE: You can not edit the template using Preview.

**Edit**
To edit a template, click Edit. You can update the Policy, Apps, Branding, Settings, Group and Add Devices options as you wish. To save the changes, click on the Update button on the Preview page.

**Duplicate**
To copy a template, click Duplicate. You can then rename the template and update the Policy, Apps, Branding, Settings, Group and Add Devices options as you wish. Any IMEI or Serial Numbers in the original template will not be carried over to the duplicated template. To save the changes, click on the Update button on the Preview page.

### Upload IMEI CSV

To upload a set of IMEI/Serial Numbers for devices you want to provision using the AfW or for Esper Enhanced Android devices with this template, click **Upload IMEI CSV**. The CSV file containing the IMEI and serial numbers must adhere to the following conditions:

   - The CSV requires the first entry of "imei1, imei2, serial number".
   - Then on each cell below enter "[IMEI #], [IMEI #], [Serial Number]".
   - If you don’t want to add a second IMEI or serial number, leave the space blank between the commas
   - Thus if you are entering just IMEIs, you can make each row either "[IMEI #], [IMEI #]," or "[IMEI #], ," or ", [IMEI #],".
   - If you are entering just serial numbers, you can make each cell ", , [Serial #]".
   - The comma separation is required.
   - The IMEI numbers need to be valid 15-digit numbers; IMEIs are being validated through Luhn’s algorithm.
   - File should not be empty.
   - Don’t list more than three values in a single row.
   - Don’t upload duplicate IMEIs.
   - Don’t switch the order of IMEI and serial numbers.
   - Any time a CSV is uploaded, the previous IMEIs and Serial Numbers for that template will be deleted and replaced by the new additions from the CSV. This will not impact any devices that have already been provisioned.
   
Below is an example set of entries for a CSV file:
   - The required header
   - Two IMEIs and one Serial Number
   - Two IMEIs
   - One IMEI and one Serial Number
   - One IMEI as first entry
   - One IMEI as second entry
   - One Serial Number
   
![IMEI](./assets/NewConsole/IMEI.png)

You can also upload a CSV or individually add IMEIs and Serial Numbers when **editing a template**.

**Download Config**
Clicking Download Config will enable you to download the config.json file for use during ADB and by IMEI-based provisioning methods. Contact Esper if you have any questions. 

**Delete**
Click on Delete to delete a selected template. You will still be able to view the policy, apps, and settings of the template when viewing a device previously provisioned using that template.


### Creating a Provisioning Template

To create a provisioning template, click **Create Template**.
![Create Template](./assets/NewConsole/TemplateCreate.png)
   Enter a unique name and an optional description for the Provisioning Template, then click **Next**.
![Create PageTemplate](./assets/NewConsole/TemplateCreatePage.png)

### Compliance Policy Section

A Compliance Policy is a set of configurations or permissions that will be applied to all the devices provisioned through the template. Each configuration determines particular system behavior, in some cases including whether the device user is able to change a configuration on the device using the Android Settings app. This section lets you set the Compliance Policy that will govern all the devices provisioned using this template. You can change this after provisioning by defining a new Compliance Policy and then applying it to a Device or a Group.
![Template Policy](./assets/NewConsole/TemplatePolicy.png)

Hovering your mouse cursor over any item will give you a short explanation on-screen. Below is a detailed explanation of each of the configurations you can set in this section.

### Dropdown menus

**Lock Screen Password Rules**
  The Lock screen password rule specifies the conditions for the device unlock password, with the default being None. If you choose alphabetic or alphanumeric, you must set a minimum password length of at least 4 characters and up to 25—use the small up/down arrows to set your required password length.
  
![Lock Password](./assets/NewConsole/LockPwdLength.png)
   
  **Alphabetic**: Restricts acceptable password to only upper and lowercase alphabetic characters (A to Z, and a to z).
  
  **Alphanumeric**: Expands acceptable password to include numbers, and special characters in addition to alphabetic characters.
  
  **None**: There is no password required to unlock the device.
  
The password for a device will be set up during the initial setup of the device by the user.

Lock screen must be on in order to set Lock screen password rules. If you select either Alphabetic or Alphanumeric password rules, then Lock screen will be set to On by Esper if it is currently Off.

**Default App Permission** 
    Default app permissions determine enforcement of the runtime-permission rule across all the apps on a device including Enterprise apps installed by Esper, in-ROM apps that are enabled, as well as any installed via Managed Google Play. This ensures you can control the user experience on the device regarding how run-time permissions are granted. There are three possible settings:

   **Allow Automatically**: This rule will grant all the permissions any app requests without showing a prompt to the user. This is the typical setting used for single-purpose solutions using a fully trusted, customer-supplied application.
   
   **Ask User**: This keeps the default behavior intact with regards to permission management. All apps on the device will show a prompt to the user to request permission. For example, by choosing this option then every app will ask the user each time before accessing a device module with a message such as "Allow app X to access Gallery? Allow/Deny". This may be unsuitable for some solutions, especially Kiosk-based apps. It can be useful for certain unusual situations dealing with App permissions—contact us directly to find out more.
   
   **Deny Automatically**: This rule will deny any permission request from any app on the device. No notification will be shown to the user. You can grant permissions to apps individually from the Esper Console.

**System Updates** 
    The System updates option allows you to enforce a system update policy on the device when a system update is available via the device’s over-the-air (OTA) update service. There are four possible settings:
    
   **Update automatically**: This option will install any over-the-air (OTA) updates automatically as soon as they become available without user interaction,  and reboot the devices when necessary.
   
   **Postpone installation**: This option postpones installation of an OTA update for 30 days. After 30 days, the system will prompt the device user to install the update. Subsequent updates will also follow the same 30-day postponement. This is ideal when you need time to validate your solution against new system updates before they are installed.
   
   **Windowed Installation**: This option allows you to define a window of time during which the OTA update will be installed without user interaction. This option is ideal for devices with a known down period. A drop-down will appear to enable you to set the start and end times for the maintenance window.
   
   **Disable Update**: This option allows you to disable updates on the device. It is available for a limited set of OTA services that support this feature. If the device does not support disabling updates, it will default to Postpone installation. Before setting this option please contact Esper directly to make sure the devices you plan to provision support this configuration.

**Android Settings App**
   Android settings app determines how device users can access the Android device settings. There are three possible settings:
   **System settings app**: This setting will display the icon for the default Android settings app on the Home screen. Clicking this icon will take the user to the default Android settings. Depending on the other configurations set by the Compliance Policy, some options may be disabled to the user. If an app is set up in Kiosk mode on the device, the System settings app will be inaccessible to the device user while the app is in Kiosk mode.
   
   **None**: No icon for any settings app will be available for the user to choose from the device’s Home screen.
   
   **Esper settings app**: Esper offers a custom settings app that gives device users access to a subset of the available Android settings when servicing a device. The Esper settings app is intended for use by technicians servicing a device locally. It is protected by the Dock & Esper Settings App password to prevent unauthorized access. This app offers a reduced number of settings.
   
      - Wi-Fi: Change the Wi-Fi access point used by the device.
      - Torch: Turn on the Torch (AKA "flashlight") if the device has a camera flash LED.
      - Auto-Rotation: Turn auto-rotation on or off.
      - Factory Reset: Perform a factory reset of the device, regardless of the Compliance Policy applied. 
      - Kiosk App: Change the app that runs in kiosk mode. The device user can choose any installed app on the device to act as the kiosk app, with the Esper Console kept in sync on the configuration stats.
      - Esper Branding: Turn off the Esper logo on the Home screen.
      - About: Supplies information regarding the endpoint name the device is enrolled in, in case the customer has access to multiple Esper endpoints.
      
![Esper Settings](./assets/NewConsole/EsperSettingsApp.png)

**Dock & Esper Settings App** 
    The dock is specifically for devices in Kiosk mode. When a device is in kiosk mode, you can access the dock by tapping 3 times in the upper left corner of the screen, or by pressing the power button consecutively 3 times with a slight pause between each press. When you do so, an expander arrow will slide out of the upper right corner:
Tap the expander arrow; you’ll need to enter the password you set in the Compliance Policy.

![Slider](./assets/NewConsole/DeviceAppSlider.jpg)

   Once you’ve entered the password, a dock will slide out that gives you three options:
      - Exit Kiosk mode. If the device is in multi-app mode, no action is taken.
      - Reboot the device.
      - Open the  Esper Settings app; selecting the Esper Settings app will require you to enter the password again to gain access.
      
![Settings App](./assets/NewConsole/SettingsAppDevice.jpg)

To slide the dock back in, click on the expander arrow again; it will disappear after a few seconds.

:::tip
If you exit Kiosk mode into multi-app mode, you can still activate the expander arrow to ensure you can put the device back into Kiosk mode locally even if the Esper Settings app was not included on the Home screen.Dock and Esper Settings App Password
:::

This password controls access to the hidden dock available in kiosk mode, the Esper Settings app, and serves as the PIN used for IMEI-based provisioning via AfW. The password is alphanumeric and can be from 1 to 10 characters.

![Dock Esper Settings](./assets/NewConsole/DockEsperSettings.png)

The default password is 1234. It is possible to set up a template without a password for these features, or just leave the default password; Esper strongly recommends setting up a more complex password for stronger security. The same password will be set for all devices provisioned using the template.

:::tip
If your device is set up in Kiosk mode, the dock will be accessible even if you choose either no settings app or the Android settings app as part of your applied Compliance Policy. That means you should set an appropriate password for the Dock & Esper Settings app if you plan to deploy your devices in Kiosk mode.
:::

### Google Account Restrictions

This setting enables you to restrict the number of Google accounts that can be added on the device and used with Google apps like Gmail, Google Play Store, and YouTube. By default, any number of accounts can be added to a specific device; this setting restricts this number. For example, if you set this setting to two, only two accounts will be permitted on the device, further addition (or deletion) of accounts will not be possible unless a different Compliance policy is reapplied.

:::tip If you don’t check the Google account restrictions box and plan to provision your device in Multi application mode, we recommend disabling Google Play Store to prevent installation of unapproved apps.
:::

![Google Account Restrictions](./assets/NewConsole/GoogleAccountRestrictions.png)

:::tip
The Google Account Restriction feature is applicable only to Google Mobile Services (GMS) Android devices. If you include the Android Settings App and wish to prevent any Google accounts from being added, set **Number of accounts** to 0.
:::


### Factory Reset Protection 

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) enables you to lock a device if a user factory resets it via soft/hard keys on GMS devices. In case of a factory reset, the device will get locked and can only be unlocked by entering a pre-authorized google account ID. Additional information about how to get your Google Account ID is available in the Compliance Policy section.

When you turn on the FRP button, you’ll need to enter the Google ID of the account you want to use to authorize post factory resets on the devices provisioned with this template.

![Factory Reset Protection](./assets/NewConsole/SettingsFactoryReset.png)

:::tip
This feature is only available on GMS devices running Android 5.1 and above.
:::

See [here](./console/policy-management/getgoogleaccount.md) to know how to get the Google account ID of your account and how FRP protects your device.

**Lock Screen**<br> If Lock Screen is on, it enables the default "lock screen" to be displayed upon a screen timeout as specified in the Settings section. If this is on, the device user will have the option to set the password. If Lock screen password rules are defined, the device user will be required to enter a password that conforms with these rules. <br/>
**Safe-Mode Login**<br> TWhen Safe-mode login is on, users will be able to boot to Safe Mode on their device; when Safe-mode login is off, users will be unable to boot to Safe Mode.<br/>
**Factory Reset**<br> Factory Reset controls whether or not the user can perform a factory reset on the device using the Android Settings app. When Factory Reset is off, the user will not be able to perform a factory reset on the device. This does not prevent a hard-key factory reset, see Factory Reset Protection to prevent hard-key factory reset. <br/>
**Notification bar**<br> If you want device users to be able to swipe down to see the notification bar, set Notification Bar to on. If you don’t, set it to off. You will typically want this off for Kiosk mode-based solutions. Conversely in most cases a user is required to submit a Bug Report that was requested through Esper via the Notification Bar, thus inaccessible with the Notification Bar turned off. <br/>
**Screenshot**<br> If you want device users to be able to take screenshots, set Screenshot to On. If you don’t, set it to Off. This will prevent users from initiating a screenshot using the appropriate hardkey sequence or available softkey on the device. <br/>
**USB connectivity**<br> USB connectivity allows users to connect USB devices—things like flash drives, digital cameras, mice, or keyboards—to the device. If you want device users to be able to connect other hardware to the device, set USB Connectivity to on. If you don’t, set it to off.<br/>
**SMS**<br> SMS controls the ability of the device to send or receive text messages via short-message service (SMS). If it is turned Off, the device will not send or receive text messages regardless of which SMS app is used. Set SMS to on if you wish to enable the device to send and receive text messages via SMS. <br/>
**Outgoing calls** <br> OIf you want device users to be able to make outgoing calls, set Outgoing Calls to on. If you don’t, set it to off. <br/>
**Camera Access**<br> If you want device users to be able to use the camera, set Camera Access to on. If you don’t, set it to off. 
:::tip 
Your app will still be able to access the camera if this setting is set to off.<br/>
:::
**NFC** <br> If you want device users to be able to use near-field communication (NFC) on their devices—on those devices that support NFC—set NFC to on; if you don’t, set it to off. If any of your apps require NFC, make sure this setting is set to on. <br/>
**Google PlayStore**<br>If you want device users to have access to your Managed Google Play Store, set the Google Play Store setting to On; if you don’t, set it to Off. You’ll still be able to install any approved Google Play Store apps from Esper onto the device. This only applies to GMS devices, as AOSP devices do not include Google Play Store support.<br/>
**USB tethering**<br>USB tethering specifies if the user is able to use their device to share a mobile connection to another device such as a laptop. If you’d like device users to let their devices share a mobile connection with other devices, set the USB tethering to On; if you don’t, set it to Off.<br/>
**Edit date and time**<br> If you’d like device users to be able to set the date and time on the device, set the Edit Date and Time setting to On; if you don’t set it to Off.<br/>
**Application uninstall**<br> Setting Application uninstall to On will block app uninstallation both locally on the device and using Esper. Set it to off if you need to be able to uninstall applications remotely using Esper. 
:::tip
With this set to on you will still be able to update your application installed on the device using Esper. <br/> 
:::

**USB File transfer** <br>If you’d like device users to be able to transfer files to or from the device using a USB cable or flash drive, set USB file transfer to On; if you don’t, set it to Off.<br/>
**Google Assistant** <br> If you’d like device users to be able to use voice command via Google Assistant on devices where this is supported, set Google Assistant to On; if you don’t, set it to Off.
:::tip 
On a few devices, this setting may need to be on if you wish to have Google Play Store show up on the device.  <br> 
:::

**Local App Install**<br>TThis feature allows installation of apps from unknown sources on the device. To enable this on the device, the user needs to follow these instructions. **Settings >Apps and Notifications > Special App Permissions> Install Unknown Apps** and choose the route they wish to install the apps from. For example, if the device user chooses Chrome, they will be able to download and install apps from the Chrome browser on the device. If turned off, the device user will not be allowed to install apps from any unknown sources.</br>

### Restrict Incoming and Outgoing calls

   Selecting the checkbox next to Restrict outgoing/incoming calls using customised dialer opens up two more checkboxes:
      - Restrict incoming calls to uploaded contacts only
      - Restrict outgoing calls to uploaded contacts only
Selecting either or both of these checkboxes will restrict incoming or outgoing calls to a specific list of telephone numbers, which you need to then upload to the device using a .csv file.
The .csv file format is one phone number per cell row using the first column, with each number preceded by the country code - see the example below.

![Upload Phone](./assets/NewConsole/PhoneNumberCSV.png)

Only one upload file is stored for each, if you upload a new file the old entries are deleted and only the entries from the new file are used.
If you wish to enable outbound calls, be sure to include your device’s phone app as a package name for [Preloaded apps in Apps] if the phone app is preinstalled.

:::tip
Spreadsheets commonly interpret + as part of a mathematical formula. Use the appropriate method specific to that spreadsheet to indicate the number is not part of a formula. For example in Excel you prepend a ‘ to each entry. Remember to save the file as a .csv.
:::

### ADB

Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is a command-line tool that enables developers to use a Unix shell to communicate with an Android device. If the ADB option is checked in the device’s Compliance Policy, you may turn on ADB via Devices > Device > Settings for a configurable time period. If the ADB option is unchecked in the Compliance Policy, ADB can not be turned on from Settings. Most stock Android devices will require opening the port on the device for the Esper agent to set up a secure connection to the Esper Cloud for ADB debugging. You can find out more about using ADB with Esper here.

:::tip
We never allow turning on ADB from the device on any Esper-provisioned device.
:::

### Resetting to Default Settings

You may reset these values to default at any time by clicking the **Reset to defaults** button at the bottom of this panel.
When you are satisfied with your Compliance Policy configurations, click **Next**.


### Apps section

The Apps section lets you choose the apps you would like to have installed on your device during provisioning. You may choose to install Enterprise apps uploaded via the [App Management](./console.md#apps) section of the Console or apps approved via [Play For Work](./console/play-work/index.md) from your Managed Google Play Store account.  

![App Template](./assets/NewConsole/TemplateApps.png)

### Kiosk or Multi-App Mode 

Your first step is click a radio button to choose either Kiosk mode or Multi application mode.

![AppMode Template](./assets/NewConsole/TemplateAppMode.png)

**Kiosk mode** pins a selected Enterprise or Google Play Store app to the device unless the user exits kiosk mode. This is useful for cases in which the device will be used for a single purpose—for example, an airport kiosk—and only the selected app needs to run on it.

:::tip 
For an optimal Kiosk mode implementation other Compliance Policy configurations need to be properly set. See this [technical article](https://blog.esper.io/kiosk-on-esper) for more details.
:::

In **Multi application mode**, the device user is free to use any Enterprise or Google Play app approved and installed using Esper.

### Advanced Settings

Clicking on **Advanced Settings** will launch a dialog box in which you can select either the Esper DPC Launcher or the default Android launcher.

![Launcher](./assets/NewConsole/Launcher.png)

Most users will use the default setting: the Esper DPC Launcher. If you select **Esper DPC Launcher**, the Esper Device agent will take administrative control of the device and only approved apps will be able to be installed or used. All the features of Esper Device agents will be functional. This gives you more control over the apps that can be used and the actions that can be taken on the device.

If you select **Default Android Launcher**, the default Android launcher will be used. The device user will be able to exit the Esper Agent (DPC) as they would any other Android app. DPC will continue to run in the background and provide some device management, but many management features will not be available. Specifically, the following will be unavailable:
   - Capture Screenshot
   - Remote View and Remote Control
   - Over-the-Air OS updates for Esper Enhanced Android OS
   - Latest Device Agent updates for Devices with Android version less than 6.0
   
The device screen will look and act much like a regular Android device with Esper Device Agent showing up as an app that can be opened and closed.

![EsperApp](./assets/NewConsole/DeviceEsperApp.png)
   
Even when the device user has exited Esper Device Agent they‘ll be able to see it running in the background in the notification bar. This feature is for very specific use cases, if you are unsure whether you should use the Default Android Launcher please contact Esper.
There is also a checkbox that allows you to include or bypass Google Play setup during provisioning on GMS devices. If this is unchecked, the Google Play store will not be set up on the device—reducing provisioning time dramatically. If you have enrolled the device into a Managed Google Play account, the default value for this is on; if the endpoint is not enrolled then the default is off. It does not apply to Android Open Source Project devices that are non-GMS.
Once you have made your selection, click **Close**.

**Preloaded Apps**
Android devices normally come with a number of apps loaded onto them in ROM. This field enables you to select which of these will be available on the device after provisioning. Enter the package names of any preloaded apps you want to show up into this field. Package names must be separated by commas.
:::tip
One easy way to find the package names is to provision one of your devices and then view the Preloaded Apps on that device—the package name for each app will be listed. You can also use ADB as well. You currently can not set a Preloaded App as the Kiosk mode app via a Provisioning Template, but you can do so at the Device level after the device has been provisioned.
:::

![Preloaded Apps](./assets/NewConsole/PreloadedApps.png)

**Esper Cloud Apps**
The **Esper Cloud Apps** tab gives you the ability to load any Enterprise apps and approved Managed Google Play apps onto the device when it is provisioned. These apps must have been previously uploaded to Esper as an Enterprise app through Apps or previously approved through Managed Google Play.

:::tip
Before using a managed Google Play account, you need to set up a Managed Google Play account through Esper.
Once an Enterprise app has been uploaded into your Esper Cloud Endpoint, select it from the dropdown menu, then select the version, and click on Add to add it to your template.
:::

![App Version](./assets/NewConsole/EsperCloudAppVersion.png)
 
**Play Store Apps**
The Play store apps section of the Your App tab gives you the ability to load approved apps from the Google Play Store onto the device as it is provisioned. This section will only appear if you have enrolled your endpoint in [Managed Google Play]. These apps must have been approved through Play for Work before they can be selected here. Simply click on the approved Play Store app you wish to install, and it will be added to the list of apps.

![PlayStore Apps](./assets/NewConsole/PlayStoreApps.png)
   
:::tip 
If you include a Google Play Store app in your template but use it to provision a non-GMS device without support for Google Play, the app will not be installed when provisioned.
:::

**Play Store Tab**
For convenience, a **Play Store** tab has been provided on this page where you can approve Google apps you’d like to add to your template. This option is only available if you have set up a [Managed Google Play] account, and is mirrored in [Apps].

![Play Store](./assets/NewConsole/PlayStore.png)

:::tip
Only once you approve a Google Play Store app, you may add it from the list shown in the Provisioning Template under Your app.
:::
When you are satisfied with your apps settings, click **Next**.

### Branding section

The Branding section lets you customize the devices you’re provisioning by uploading the wallpapers that will be displayed on the device once it’s provisioned. You can upload separate portrait and landscape wallpapers. If your device is fixed to a display orientation you only need to upload the wallpaper for that orientation.

This does not apply to devices deployed in Kiosk mode.

Supported image formats are JPEG, PNG, or JPG with a 25MB size limit. Be sure to crop the image to match the screen resolution of the devices you plan to provision with this template, otherwise they will be stretched to fit.

![Template Branding](./assets/NewConsole/TemplateBranding.png)
   
To preview the Portrait wallpaper you uploaded, click **See preview**.
When you are satisfied with your wallpaper, click **Next**.

### Settings section

The Settings section lets you determine levels for most of the device settings—things like screen brightness, alarm volume, and screen timeout. You can also set up devices with Wi-Fi credentials, along with determining the duration of an ADB session if ADB was enabled in the [Compliance Policy] section.

![Template Settings](./assets/NewConsole/TemplateSettings.png)
   
:::tip 
If the **Android Settings App** is enabled for a device in Multi application mode, the device user can access these settings and change them on the device.
:::

**General Device Settings**
Most of these are fairly straightforward:
   - Turn Bluetooth on or off.
   - Turn Wi-Fi on or off*.
   - Select GPS accuracy from the dropdown menu.
   - Set the brightness of the screen using a slider.
   - Set the alarm volume using a slider.
   - Set notification volume using a slider.
   - Set music volume using a slider.
   - Set ring volume using a slider.
   - Select screen orientation from the dropdown menu (Auto, Landscape, or Portrait)*.
   - Select screen timeout duration—the time after which the device screen will turn off if left idle—ranging from 15 seconds to Never (meaning the screen will always be on, important for Kiosk mode deployments.
   - Select the time zone in which the device will be deployed; after deployment, you will have the ability to change the device’s time zone remotely via dashboard. If you don’t specify a device time zone, the time zone set by the device will be used.
   
*If the device only uses Wi-Fi for Internet connectivity, since Esper requires the device to be connected to the Internet in order for the Esper system to work, Esper will turn Wi-Fi on after 10 seconds to establish the required Internet connectivity.*

*Some device makers swap the settings for Landscape and Portrait. If your device was provisioned with a specific orientation but is locked into the other orientation, try swapping this setting to achieve the proper screen orientation setting.*

The Time Zone field has a robust search capability. As you begin to type, suggestions will be displayed. For example, typing "Pacific" will bring up all the time zones that start with "Pacific." Listings are by country, for example to find the timezones for the U.S.A., search for "America" or "US".

![Timezone](./assets/NewConsole/Timezone.png)
   
**ADB**

Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is a command-line tool that enables administrators to use a Unix shell to communicate with an android device. If ADB was checked in the Compliance Policy section, you can turn on ADB here for a configurable time period. If ADB wasn’t checked in the Compliance Policy section, ADB can not be turned on here.

![ADB Duration](./assets/NewConsole/ADBDuration.png)
   
:::tip
Keeping ADB set to "Always ON" is NOT recommended for security reasons.
:::

**WIFI Access Points**

You can preload preferred Wi-Fi networks to which the provisioned device will automatically connect as they become available.

![WIFI Network](./assets/NewConsole/WIFIAccessPoint.png)
   
The device will automatically connect to the given WiFi access points as per the availability and network strength after provisioning.
 
:::tip
The WiFi on/off and WiFi access points feature are not available for android 10.0 and above
:::

This section has four fields to configure: Wi-Fi SSID, Wi-Fi Password, Wi-Fi Security type, and whether the access point is hidden. The Wi-Fi SSID and Wi-Fi Password fields are text fields into which you enter the SSID and password for the access point. Select the security type from the dropdown menu. There are four possible choices:
   - NONE
   - WPA
   - WEP
   - EAP
If you select EAP, an extra dropdown menu will appear to enable you to select a Phase 2 Authorization protocol:
   - NONE
   - PAP
   - MSCHAP
   - MSCHAPV2
   - GTC
   - SIM
   - AKA
   - AKA_PRIME
   
![WIFI Network Details](./assets/NewConsole/WIFIAccessPointDetails.png)

:::tip
The Wi-Fi On/Off and Wi-Fi Access Points feature are not available for Android 10.0 and newer.
:::

**Add Wi-Fi Credentials to Be Used During Provisioning***
This feature gives you the capability to include the required Wi-Fi credentials in the QR code generated by a Provisioning Template. After reading the QR code, the provisioned device will automatically connect to these access points as they become available.

![Add WIFI Template](./assets/NewConsole/TemplateAddWifi.png)
   
Like  Wi-Fi Access Points, this section has three fields: Wi-Fi SSID, Wi-Fi Password, and Wi-Fi Security type. The Wi-Fi SSID and Wi-Fi Password fields are text fields into which you enter the SSID and password for the access point. Select the security type from the dropdown menu. There are four possible choices:
   - NONE
   - WPA
   - WEP
   - EAP
If you select EAP, an extra dropdown menu will appear to enable you to select a Phase 2 Authorization protocol:
   - NONE
   - PAP
   - MSCHAP
   - MSCHAPV2
   - GTC
   - SIM
   - AKA
   - AKA_PRIME
   
Hidden access points are not supported for use during provisioning.
When you are satisfied with your settings, click **Next**.

### Group section

The Group section lets you assign devices provisioned using this template to an existing group, or to create a new group.

![Template Group](./assets/NewConsole/TemplateGroup.png)
   
To select an existing group, click the radio button next to its name. If you’d like to create a new group, click **Create a new group**. Enter a unique name for the new group into the popup menu that appears. Once the new group is created, it will automatically be selected and used with this template.

![Create Group](./assets/NewConsole/GroupCreateName.png)

When you are satisfied with your group selection, click **Next**.

**Add Devices (IMEI Provisioning)**
If you are editing a template—rather than creating one—the next section will be Add Devices. The **Add Devices** section gives you the option to individually add or delete the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) or serial numbers of devices you want to provision with this template. You can also upload a CSV file containing IMEIs and Serial Numbers. Please format your CSV using the instructions in **Upload IMEI CSV** section.

![Add Devices Template](./assets/NewConsole/TemplateAdddevices.png)

To manually add a device to be provisioned, enter either its serial number or its IMEI in the **Add IMEI/Serial Number** field and click on the **Add** button.

![Add IMEI Template](./assets/NewConsole/TemplateIMEIAdd.png)

Within a few seconds, the IMEI or serial number will be registered with the backend. The newly added device’s IMEI or serial number will appear in the **IMEI/Serial Number** field, and a toast notification will appear in the bottom left corner of the Console:

![Success Message](./assets/NewConsole/SuccessMessage.png)

:::tip
Esper validates all IMEI numbers entered. If you enter an IMEI that cannot be verified as an valid IMEI number, you’ll get an error. Additionally if the IMEI or Serial Number is already associated with another Provisioning Template, you’ll also get an error.
:::

Click **Next**.

### Preview

The Preview section gives you a preview of the entire Provisioning Template. If you wish to edit any settings, use the Back button to go back to the appropriate screen:

![Preview Template](./assets/NewConsole/TemplatePreview.png)

When you are satisfied with your template, click **Save**. You will see a pop-up to confirm your settings. Click **Okay**. If you are creating a new template and select **Cancel**, the system will discard the template you are creating; if you’re editing an existing template, the system will discard any changes made to the template.

![Confirm Save](./assets/NewConsole/SaveConfirm.png)
   
**Template Tiles**
Your new Provisioning Template will now be visible as a tile on the Provisioning Templates page. You can search for it in the search bar. 
You can also sort the tiles using the sorting dropdown:
   - Recently Created
   - Recently Updated
   - Ascending (A to Z)
   - Descending (Z to A)
To preview your new template, click on it. To provision a device using your new template using a QR Code-based provisioning method, click on **View QR Code**.
When you have clicked **View QR Code**, you’ll also have the option to download the config.json file you can use during ADB and IMEI provisioning via Google Zero-Touch or Samsung Knox Mobile Enrollment. Simply click **Download Config**.

![QRCode](./assets/NewConsole/QRCode.png)

These templates will also be available for use via the Esper Device Provisioner.
You can delete a Provisioning Template by clicking on **Delete Template**. If you do so, the information about the Provisioning Template will be saved to display for any device that has been provisioned using the deleted template.
 

## Devices

The Devices section is where you manage your Esper-provisioned devices after the provisioning steps have been completed.

### Getting Started

If you’re logging in to your Console for the first time you will see the following screen which gives you a choice to either provision a device or Simulate a device.

![Simulare Page](./assets/NewConsole/DevicesInitial.png)

If you’d like to provision a real Android device, first create a [Provisioning Template] and then use one of the available [Provisioning Methods].

If you’d rather simulate an Android device, click **Simulare Device**. You will see a momentary “You are all set!” message after which a mock device will be available for you to experiment with and learn on until you’re ready to provision an actual device. You can also provision an Android Studio AVD using the [Provisioner Tool].

Capabilities such as Apps, Remote View and Capture log may not be available on a Simulated device.

:::tip
This feature is only available on accounts created after Friday, September 27, 2019. If you became an Esper client before then and would like access to a simulated device, contact us.
:::

### Device View

Once you’ve added actual or simulated devices to the Console, the **Devices** view will list all the devices under management. Every device enrolled into an Esper endpoint receives a Device ID which uses a short code prefix followed by a 4 character identifier. For example, the below devices are all ESP-DDM. You can change this identifier in [Company Settings]. You can also assign a custom alias to each device to give it a friendly name in addition to the device name, noting the Device ID is often used as a parameter by the Esper API.

![Device Tiles](./assets/NewConsole/DeviceTile.png)

There are three ways to view the devices in your Console: Grid, List and Maps. The default is grid view, but you can click on list or maps to access the list view or the map view.

:::tip
If you want to remove a device from Esper, execute a Wipe device command from Settings. If you perform a factory reset locally on the device, it will still continue to show up in Esper but will be offline. The only devices that can be directly deleted from the Esper Console without a Wipe device command are devices that are Under provisioning. If a device becomes inoperable and you wish to remove it from your Esper Endpoint, please contact us.
:::

#### Search Box

You can search device attributes for both the Grid and List views. The Search Box enables you to search for specific devices, with the search encompassing Device ID, Alias, Tags, and each Device’s information. To clear the search, simply refresh the page.

### Grid View 
Devices which are being managed by your Esper system, or that are undergoing provisioning and have started communicating with the backend, are displayed as device tiles in the grid view.

![Tile Details](./assets/NewConsole/DeviceTileView.png)

You can use Grid view by clicking on the grid icon under the Devices heading on the Devices page:

![Grid View](./assets/NewConsole/GridView.png)

#### Filtering the Grid View Device List by Category

You can filter the list of devices managed by your console by category. To do so, check the boxes next to the categories you would like displayed. The available categories are:

   Under provisioning — devices undergoing provisioning 
   Online devices — currently online  
   Offline devices — currently offline
   No risk devices — device with security status secure
   Low risk devices — device with security status low
   Medium risk devices — devices with security status medium
   High risk devices — devices with security status high
   Devices with low battery — devices with battery level under 30% charge
   Recently added devices — devices provisioned within the last 3 days
   
You’ll find more information about how we determine the security status of a device in [Security].
You can also search for a specific device using the **Search** box at the top of the screen. The device alias, Device ID, and any tags are all included in the search scope.

#### Grid View Drop Down Options
Clicking on the ellipsis button (...) on the top right corner of the device tile brings up the following options: 

![Device Actions](./assets/NewConsole/DeviceEllipsis.png)

#### View on Map

Click View on maps to see the location of the device on a map:

![MapView](./assets/NewConsole/Maps.png)

#### Add or Edit tags

Click on Add tags to add tags to the device. Tags can make it easier to identify devices in a specific location, types of devices, Wi-Fi, SSID or any other information that would be useful. If a tag already exists for a device, the drop down choice changes to Edit Tags. You can also click on + ADD A TAG on the tile itself to add or edit tags - this option only shows if one or more tags are available to be added to that device.
When you click Add Tags, the following pop up will appear: 

![Add Tags](./assets/NewConsole/TagsAdd.png)

Enter your tag in the text box and click **Add**. Continue to do so until you’ve entered your set of tags.

:::tip
You’re limited to three tags per device, and each tag is limited to 30 characters.
:::

If tags already exist for a device, you’ll also be able to edit or delete existing tags:

![Edit Tags](./assets/NewConsole/DeviceTag.png)

Click the pencil icon next to a tag to edit it; click the garbage can icon to delete it. You may edit or delete the tags using actions. On clicking the edit (pencil icon) the text box lets you edit and update the tag as shown below. 

#### Remove from Group

**Remove from Group** will only appear if the device is part of a group other than the Default group. Clicking **Remove from Group** will remove the device from the group and make it a part of the Default Group. Use this if you wish to stage the device in the Default Group to move it to another Group.

#### Device Rename

Esper assigns a unique Device ID to every device enrolled on the Esper platform. This Device ID will be prominently displayed in the device tile and device lists. If you’d rather use your own naming convention, click **Device Rename**, enter a custom alias name in the text box provided, and click **Save Changes**.

![Rename Device](./assets/NewConsole/DeviceRename.png)

The new device name will appear in all Console views, including the device home screen. This name is actually an alias; we’ll still continue to use the Device ID under the hood. You can revert it to its original Device ID at any time using this same technique.

### List View

Once you have enough devices under management, it becomes impractical to view or sort them in the Grid view. List View enables you to see a list of all devices available on the dashboard along with configurable device information columns including online/offline status, serial number, group name, Android version, and tags.

![List View](./assets/NewConsole/DeviceListView.png)

To switch to List View, simply click on the List View icon underneath the Devices heading.

![ListView Button](./assets/NewConsole/ListView.png)

Each Device Name is a link that will take you to the details of that device. 

By default, the list is sorted in descending order of device registration date (e.g. the date the device was provisioned). Several of the columns are sortable, you can identify them by the arrows to the right of the name. Simply click on the header for that column to use it as the sort criteria. The currently used sort will be highlighted, in this example the sort is from the most recently registered device.

![List Sorting](./assets/NewConsole/RegisteredOn.png)

#### Actions Button

To use the Actions button, check the box next to the device or devices you wish to take an action, then click the Actions button. 

![Actions](./assets/NewConsole/ListviewActions.png)

If you have not selected a device, Actions will be greyed out and you will see a pop up advising you to select at least one device.

![Actions Message](./assets/NewConsole/ListViewActionsMessage.png)

You’ll be able to do the following actions via drop down list, without having to navigate to other sections of the Console:
   Ping
   Reboot
   App install
   App uninstall
   Apply policy

When you select an action, a sidebar appears where you then need to click on the action to initiate it. For example clicking Ping will bring in a pane from the right side of the screen enabling you to ping the selected devices.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/AppInstallDetails.png)

Hovering over the progress bar offers additional detail about the process—in this case app installation.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/QueuedMessage.png)

Hovering over the progress bar will provide additional detail about the process on any command status progress menu.

#### Table Settings Button

Clicking on the **Table settings** button (the button with a gear on it in between the **Actions** and **Filter** buttons) will bring in a slide-in pane that allows you to add and remove columns, control the density of your table, and perform other customization activities to improve the look and function of your Device Lists.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/TableSettings.png)   

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/ListViewTableSettings.png)

To add or remove columns from this list, click the down arrow. Select any columns you wish to add; unselect any you wish to remove and click **Apply**. You can also change the table density by clicking on any of the three options.

#### Filter Button

You can also apply filters to your List View by clicking on the **Filter** button.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/ListViewFilter.png)

Currently, you can only filter by one value of each value. For example, you can choose Group A, Policy B and Active which will give you a filtered list of devices in Group A which are active and have policy B applied on them.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/ListViewFilterAndroid.png)

Once you select the filter parameters, click **Apply** to update the List View. 
Custom filters to Device List view are stored locally via browser caching. Your sort preferences will be applied automatically when you return to this page unless you update your preferences or clear your cache. You can return to the unfiltered view by clicking **Reset**.

#### Download Devices List Button

Clicking the **Download Devices List** button enables you to download the device data for your current set of devices in List View to an CSV or Excel spreadsheet.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/ReportDownload.png)

#### Activity Feed Button

Clicking the Device Details icon when no devices are selected brings a slide out from the right side of the screen listing the history of all commands fired by any user for the devices on the list.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/RebootPreview.png)

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/DeviceActivityFeed.jpg)

Clicking **View Details** will show more details (including the current status) of each command. The pop-up box will then provide details of each command—including the devices that are currently in an In progress, Success, Queued, or Failed state.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/StatusSuccess.jpg)

If you’ve selected a single device,clicking the Device Details icon will show the details and activity for that device. The Activity tab will show all activities done on that device. If you selected more than one device, no details will be shown.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/ListViewActivityFeed.jpg)

### Map View

The Map view shows device locations on a map. This view can be filtered by selecting the types of devices from the dropdown.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/DevicesMapView.png)

To view the devices in a cluster, click on the cluster icon. Click on an individual device to see information about that device. Devices without location information will not be shown on the map. 
Clicking on a device pin will bring up the Device Tile for that device. To go to that device’s Information page, simply click on View Details.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/MapDevice.png)

:::tip
Bear in mind that some devices—such as Wi-Fi only or Ethernet connected devices—may not report an accurate geolocation. The view is currently limited to 100 devices; once you exceed 100 provisioned devices this view is no longer available.
:::

### Device Details

Clicking **View Details** at the bottom of a device tile enables you to see additional detail about that device in either Grid View or Map View. You can also go to a device’s detail in List View by clicking on the Device Name in the list. 

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/DeviceTileDetails.png)

### Information Tab

This is the first tab that comes in view when clicking on View Details on the Device tile. This section provides extensive information about the device, including:

   Storage (total storage available, storage used, OS-occupied storage, and internal storage)
   Memory Information (total, in-use, average used, free)

### Settings Tab

The Settings tab enables you to remotely adjust the settings on any of the devices you manage through the Console. By default many of the options are collapsed—to expand an option simply click on the drop down icon located on the right side of each option. The image below shows Settings with all the options expanded.
 
![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/DeviceSettingsAll.png)

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/Settings.png)

Some details for each action and setting:

**Reboot**

Clicking Reboot and then Confirm will reboot the device. This can be useful when you’re having trouble communicating with the device or when the system is unstable.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/RebootButton.png)

**Screen Lock**

Clicking Screen Lock and then Confirm will lock the screen on the device. The device user will then need to enter the device password—if a password has been set—to use the device again. This can be used to avoid unwanted usage if the device were ever to fall into the wrong hands.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/Screenlock.png)

**Heart Beat**

Esper Managed devices are continuously communicating with our Cloud and updating their statuses every minute. If a device dozes off due to inactivity or a bad network connection, our Cloud will regularly wake them and ask for a status update.
Clicking Ping Device lets you accomplish the same task manually.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/HeartbeatButton.png)

**Device Lockdown**

Clicking Lockdown triggers a complete lockdown of the device. This is useful to prevent unauthorized use or relocation.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/Lockdown.png)

When you click **Lockdown**, a custom message text box appears where you can enter the text you want the device user to see.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/LockdownConfirm.png)

In this example, after the device has been locked down, the user will see the following screen.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/LockdownDevice.jpg)

After locking down a device, the button will change to Unlock to enable you to unlock the device from the Console.

**Wipe Device**

Click **Wipe Device** to perform a remote factory reset on the device. If you want to wipe the external storage also (if available), select the **Yes** radio button under **Wipe external data?**. Confirm by clicking **Confirm**.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/WipeAction.png)

This command is useful when a device needs to be reprovisioned using a different template. It can also be used if the device’s system has crashed and is unusable; wiping the device will bring it back to its original factory settings so the device can be freshly configured and the device will be removed from the Esper Cloud.

:::tip
If the device user executes a factory reset directly on the device, the device will still appear in your Esper Endpoint as an offline device. If you re-provision the same device on your Esper Endpoint, it will keep the same Device ID but you will need to re-enter the custom alias and any tags you previously added for the device.
:::

**Device Mode**

The Device mode function enables you to switch a device between multi-app mode and kiosk mode. When a device is in Multi application mode, the user can see and use all the approved apps; when a device is in Kiosk mode, the device acts like a kiosk and users can only use the kiosk app. Oftentimes users provision with additional apps useful for setup and diagnostics at customer sites. Device mode makes it easy to switch out of Kiosk mode to make those apps available for use by a field technician or customer, and then switch back into Kiosk mode when done.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/KioskmodeSwitch.png)

To change a device to Kiosk mode, click **Switch to Kiosk mode**. A panel will slide in from the right side; click the radio button for the mode you prefer. If you click the **Kiosk mode** radio button, you will also need to choose the app that will be pinned to the device’s start screen as its primary app; Select it from the searchable Select **kiosk app** dropdown and click **Save**.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/DeviceMode.png)

To switch a device in Kiosk mode to Multi application mode click on **Switch to Multi Application mode** (you can also click on **Change**). 

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/MultiAppSwitch.png)

The same panel will slide out, select the **Multi application mode** radio button, and then click **Save**.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/MultiAppMode.png)

:::tip
In some situations a device provisioned in Kiosk mode will be unable to connect to the Internet—if, for example, a Wi-Fi access point has changed credentials. In these cases the Esper Dock can be used to open the Esper Settings app giving access to Wi-Fi settings locally on the device.
:::

**Display**

This section lets you adjust the display settings of the device. 

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/DisplayScreenOrientation.png)

Use the Brightness slider to Increase or decrease the brightness of the screen.

Use the Screen Orientation buttons to select your preferred screen orientation, whether auto, landscape, or portrait.

Select a time from the Screen Timeout dropdown menu.

Once all changes are made, click Apply changes to push them out to the device, or Cancel if you wish to keep the current settings.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/SettingsDisplay.png)

A toast message will appear in the bottom right section of the screen indicating success or failure for each change applied to the device:

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/Toast.png)

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/ErrorChangeSettings.png)   
           
**Sound**

This section lets you adjust the sound settings of the device. Use the sliders to adjust the:
   Alarm volume
   Notification volume
   Music volume
   Ring volume

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/SettingsSound.png)

Once all changes are made, click Apply changes to push them out to the device, or Cancel if you wish to keep the current settings.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/CancelApplyChanges.png)

After applying any changes, individual toast messages will appear in the bottom left corner of the screen indicating success or error for each change made.

**Wi-Fi & Internet**

This section enables you to turn Wi-Fi off on the device and push new Wi-Fi access point credentials to the device.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/WIFIInternet.png)

You can toggle Wi-Fi for the device on or off. This can be done if the device has an alternative connection available such as cellular network via SIM card or Ethernet. You will need to Confirm turning it off before this action is pushed to the device:

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/WIFIConfirm.png)

After turning Wi-Fi off (or back on if the device has another means to connect to the internet), a toast message will appear in the bottom right corner of the screen indicating success or error.

:::tip
If you switch off Wi-Fi when no other connection is available, Esper will turn Wi-Fi back on after 10 seconds if no other internet connection is available so Esper can maintain communication with the cloud backend.
:::

To pre-define a preferred Wi-Fi network, click on **Add new Wi-Fi access point**. 

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/WIFIAccessPointAdd.png)

Enter the details for the new access point, including the Wi-Fi SSID, Wi-Fi Security Type, Wi-Fi Password, and whether it’s a “Hidden” network and click **Save**.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/WIFIAccessPointDetails.png)

After clicking **Save**, a toast message will appear in the bottom left corner of the screen indicating success or error for adding the new access point.

The device will now automatically connect to the specified Wi-Fi access points as they become available. Additional detail on configuring Wi-Fi security can be found [here].

To delete an access point, click on the ellipses and then **Delete**.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/WIFIEllipsis.png)

:::tip
The Wi-Fi on/off and Wi-Fi access points features are not available for Android 10.0 and above.
:::

**Location** 

This section lets you adjust the use of Global Positioning System (GPS) by the device.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/Location.png)

There are four GPS accuracy settings:
**High Accuracy** — Optimizes for accuracy using extra inferences and heuristics for quicker location resolution.
**Device Only** — Uses just the GPS chipset of device and not any extra inferences or heuristics. This can slow location resolution.
**Battery Saver** — Optimizes for longer battery life at the cost of location accuracy.
**Off** — Turns off device GPS.

Once a change is made, a toast message will appear in the bottom right corner of the screen indicating success or error for changing the GPS settings.

:::tip 
For devices that run Android 9 or above, the only two options available will be to turn GPS on or off.
:::

**Bluetooth & Devices**

This feature allows you to control any Bluetooth connections to the device. Turning off the toggle button turns the device’s Bluetooth off. When you turn the toggle button on, the information under “Paired devices” will show the Bluetooth devices paired with the Android device and whether they are currently connected.

For example when no Bluetooth device has been paired with an Android device:

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/BluetoothON.png)

When a Bluetooth device has paired with the Android device and is currently connected:

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/Bluetooth.png)

When a Bluetooth device is connected, the Console will show the device name as well as its IP address. If the Bluetooth device is disconnected, it will continue to show in the Paired Devices list, but the connection status will change to “Disconnected.”

Once a change is made, a toast message will appear in the bottom right corner of the screen indicating success or error for turning Bluetooth on or off.

Until the device user removes the device by choosing to “Forget Device” from the list of paired bluetooth devices, it will continue to show in the **Paired Devices** list.

**Time and Date**

This area enables you to manually select the time zone in which your device is deployed.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/TimeDate.png)

The Time Zone field has a robust search capability. As you begin to type, suggestions will be displayed. For example, typing “Pacific” will bring up all the time zones that start with “Pacific.”

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/Timezone.png)

Simply select the time zone you wish to change the device’s time to, and it will immediately be applied to the device.
Once a change is made, a toast message will appear in the bottom right corner of the screen indicating success or error for changing the time zone.

:::tip 
The Time and Date feature is only available for devices which are running Esper Enhanced Android or the devices for which Esper's supervisor plugin has been signed by the manufacturer of the device.
:::

**ADB access**

Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is a command-line tool that lets you communicate with Android devices using a Unix shell. With that connection up and running, you can run a variety of commands on the device.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/ADBAccessON.png)

On a managed device, you can turn on ADB using the toggle switch to enable a secure remote ADB session using Esper. When you turn on ADB, you must set the duration of the ADB session:
   Always On
   1 hour
   3 hours
   8 hours
   1 day
   
After the completion of this time period from the point of provisioning, ADB will automatically turn off for the device.

You can choose the **Always On** option to keep ADB on, but Esper does not recommend this practice; ADB is a gateway to communication with the core of the device and should be used in a highly secure manner. You can find out more about using ADB with Esper.

:::tip
We never allow turning on ADB from the device on any Esper-provisioned device.
:::

### Event Feed Tab
The Event Feed tab lists all the interactions the device has had with the Console. It displays each command taken on the device and includes the Esper use that initiated the command with a date and time stamp.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/EventfeedGeofence.png)

### Device Graphs Tab

This section provides a graphic representation of various telemetry for a specific device over the last 24 hour period. Fourteen metrics are displayed:

   Battery Capacity Total
   Battery Capacity Count
   Battery Current Average
   Battery Level
   Battery Voltage
   Battery Temperature
   Available RAM
   Available Internal Storage
   Battery Current
   Data Usage
   Wi-Fi Signal Strength
   OS Occupied Storage
   Wi-Fi Frequency
   Wi-Fi Link Speed

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/Graphs.png)

If a device stays inactive for more than seven days, you will see an alert asking that you activate the device:

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/DeviceGraphError.png)

### Apps Tab

This section lists the Apps that are installed on the device. Each lists the App Name, App Type, Version Code, Package Name, App State, and Actions. 

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/DeviceApps.jpg)

You can search for a particular application by entering part or all of the application name. 

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/InstallAppSearch.png)

The apps that are already installed on the device are specified in this list with the following filters:
   **All Apps** installed on the device
   **Enterprise Apps** which are private apps that have installed using the Esper Cloud.
   **Google Apps** installed using your managed Google Play account.
   **Preloaded Apps** which were pre-installed by the device maker in ROM.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/AppTypes.png)

An App can have 3 App States: Show, Hide, and Disable. For all installed apps you have the option to Show or Hide the app from the device home screen. If an app is set to Hide, it can still run in the background. 

If you want to prevent an app from running at all, use Disable. This is useful for apps such as in-ROM apps that cannot be uninstalled but need to be prevented from running to avoid impacting your user experience or to ensure they do not needlessly consume data. This list can be filtered by App State by selecting the drop down list. 

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/AppStateOptions.png)

Select the appropriate option to filter the list to show **All** apps, apps set to Show, apps set to Hide, or Disabled apps. 
You can refresh the list of apps and corresponding data by clicking the **Refresh** icon. 

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/RefreshButton.png)

The New App Install button lets you install new apps on the device. 

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/NewAppInstall.png)

A dialog box will slide in from the left:

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/InstallNewApp.jpg)
 
Select the app from the list of all approved Google apps and all uploaded Enterprise apps. Then select the app version number and click **Install**.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/InstallStatus.jpg)

The app installation screen also includes an estimated total time required for the installation. If an error occurs, the console will display an error message.

#### Actions Column

The Actions column enables you to uninstall an app, clear its data, set its permissions, and set the app state. To take one of these actions, click the ellipsis (...) in line with its listing.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/SetAppState.png)

#### Uninstall

Selecting **Uninstall** removes the app from the device. When you click Uninstall, a panel will slide in from the right side of the screen.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/AppUninstallconfirm.png)

Click **Yes, Uninstall**. The panel will show a progress bar.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/AppUninstall.png)

Once the progress bar is filled, the Console will display the message “Successfully uninstalled the app.” Click **Close**.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/AppUninstallSuccess.png)

:::tip
Some in-ROM apps cannot be uninstalled. 
:::

#### Clear Data

Selecting **Clear Data** clears the app data from the device. A panel will slide in from the right side of the screen.Click on **Yes, Clear**.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/AppDataClear.png)

The panel will show a progress bar. Once the progress bar is filled, the Console will display the message “Successfully uninstalled the app.” Click **Close**.

#### Set App Permission
This lets you define detailed app permission such as location granularity, access to camera, read phone state and writing to external storage.

On clicking this, a dialogue box will appear.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/SetAppPermission.png)

Simply choosing the options from the dropdown will execute the command. The permissions which are available to choose are dependent on the type of in-ROM app that is being looked at.

#### Set App State
An app can have 3 states: Show, Hide, and Disable. This action gives you control over the app’s state. Clicking Set App State brings up a dialog box:

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/AppState.png)

Click the button for the state you want this app to be in and click **Save Changes**.

:::tip
Please note that some in-ROM (preloaded) apps are designed to be uninstallable by the device manufacturers so they can be hidden but can not be uninstalled.
:::

#### Activity Feed 
Click on the info icon to the extreme right to view history of app installation and uninstall events performed on the device. This includes timestamp, App name, App version, package name, App type and status of the event (Success, In Progress, Failure, or Cancelled).

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/AppInstallInfo.png)

### Compliance Policy Tab

You can change the Compliance Policy applied to a device. This can only be done on an online device. To install a new Compliance Policy on the device, first select the policy from the dropdown menu. You need to first create a Compliance Policy to have it available in the dropdown. You’ll find more information on compliance policies in the [Compliance Policy section].

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/DeviceCompPolicy.png)

Once selected the policy is selected, you will be able to see a preview of the policy to review it before applying. To apply the click on Apply policy. A progress bar will then appear to show your the status of the policy being applied to the device.

### Security Tab

The Security tab shows the security risks faced by the device, if any. If there are risks, it will show the threat level, cause of the threat, and provide recommendations to secure the device.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/DeviceSecurity.png)

#### Security Criteria
Following are the criterion on which the security risks are calculated:

**BasicIntegrity**

BasicIntegrity gives you a signal about the general integrity of the device and its API. Rooted devices fail basicIntegrity, as do emulators, virtual devices, and devices with signs of tampering, such as API hooks.

**CtsProfileMatch**
CtsProfileMatch gives you a much stricter signal about the compatibility of the device. Only unmodified devices that have been certified by Google can pass ctsProfileMatch. Devices that will fail ctsProfileMatch include the following:
  
   Devices that fail basicIntegrity
   Devices with an unlocked bootloader.
   Devices with a custom system image (custom ROM)
   Devices for which the manufactured didn’t apply for, or pass, Google certification
   Devices with a system image built directly from Android Open Source Program source files
   Devices with a system image distributed as part of a beta or developer preview program (including the Android Beta Program)

When this alarm is thrown, the advice parameter will provide additional information which is then displayed by Esper. 

**Security Patch Version**

The last updated security patch version is used to determine if the device is up-to-date on Android security patches.

**Calculating the Security Score**

Your Esper console will receive the above values and calculate the security state as follows:
   If basicIntegrity is false, then the device is a high risk device (<=5 points)
   If basicIntegrity is true, the Console gives a little more weight to ctsProfile (3) and to Security Patch (2). if both are    false (= 5 points), the device is considered medium risk.
   If basicIntegrity is true, ctsProfileMatch is also true, and the patch version is greater than three months old, the          device is considered low risk.

The points table works out as follows:
   0-5 points → High Risk
   5-7 points → Medium Risk
   8-9 points → Low Risk
   9-10 points → Secure
   
**Security Check Frequency**

BasicIntegrity and CtsProfileMatch are calculated on three instances:
   During provisioning
   Every five hours thereafter
   When requested from the Esper Console

### Remote Viewer Tab

The Remote viewer section enables you to remotely view a device and take screenshots. To remotely view a device, click on **Start Session**.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/RemoteViewerStart.png)

On devices using Android 9.0 and above, the Console will establish a secure connection with the device and the device’s screen will be streamed to the Console. On devices Android 8.1 and earlier, users would see a permission prompt requesting permission for the remote session unless the device is Supervisor enabled.  Once the remote view request is allowed, a secure connection will get established and the device’s screen will be streamed to the Console.

:::tip
If your device is running with an app in Kiosk mode and a permission is required to initiate a remote view session, the notification will not display over the pinned Kiosk mode app. To get around this some customers exit Kiosk mode after provisioning and Always accept the notification part of their preparation process. Alternatively if the device is already in the field it can be done at the deployment site by a local device user.
:::

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/DeviceRemoteViewer.png)

The session will end automatically after 15 minutes. To end the session earlier, click **Stop Session**.

Click the **Take Screenshot** button to capture the current device screen. There is a recorded history of all screenshots captured per device at the bottom of the Remote Viewer section.

The **Portrait** button allows you to rotate the screen to portrait as well as landscape mode.

Only a single device-to-cloud session is allowed at a time.

The **Full Screen** button allows you to remotely view the device in full screen mode.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/DeviceRemoteView.png)

While in **Full Screen** mode using Remote Control, a widget at the lower right corner of the screen will enable navigation on a remote device that has hard keys. If the control widget happens to overlap with the frame, grab and move it to a clear space on the Console screen.

To enter **Full screen** mode click the button below the device screen.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/DeviceFullScreen.png)

To exit the full screen view, simply press your esc on your PC’s keyboard.

#### Remote Control

On Esper-Enhanced Android Devices, or devices that have a manufacturer signed Esper agent in the system, there is an option to Remote Control the device. This means you may interact with the remote device using your mouse as though you were physically touching the screen.

Since Esper has obtained membership in SEAP (Samsung Enterprise Alliance Program), our platform now supports Samsung Knox-specific extensions and as a result can now provide the Remote Control feature available for any Esper provisioned Samsung devices running Knox 3.x or newer.

If remote control is not supported for your device, we display a message in Remote view.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/RemoteViewerError.png)

You can use remote control in both view modes - full screen and non-full screen. But the widget is only available in full screen mode.

#### Hardware Keys and Keyboard Events

Some devices do not have soft keys for home, back and recent, using physical keys on the device itself instead. On such devices, a virtual set of keys appear at the bottom right corner of the Remote Control screen.

When in Full screen mode, the widget includes the hard keys. You can grab and move the widget to a different location on our PC’s screen as you wish.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/Screenshot.png)

Additionally, we have enabled keyboard events so users can use the keyboard on their system to type and are not forced to use the keyboard on the device by clicking on each character using the mouse pointer. This makes the experience of remote control more convenient.

### Capture Logs Tab

This feature enables you to capture a bug report from the device. To do so, click on **Capture logs** then click on **Start**. As the report is gathered, the status will change from Requesting Report to Permission Granted to Download. The Download status is actually a live link; clicking **Download** will download the bug report with date and time stamp from the device to help your technical staff debug any issues.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/DeviceCaptureLogs.png)

When you request a capture log from a specific device, a notification will pop up on that device asking permission to share the report. The device user will need to swipe down the notification bar, tap the bug report line, and tap **Share**. If the device user taps **Decline**, the report will not be shared and the status will change to Permission Denied by User.

:::tip 
If the target device is in Kiosk mode or the notification bar has not been enabled, you will be unable to capture a bug report. Kiosk mode prevents the notification bar from being displayed and the device user will not be able to grant permission for the report. To get around this you can temporarily apply a Compliance Policy with notification bar enabled.
:::

### Connecting to a Device Using Secure Remote ADB

Android Debug Bridge (ABD) is a command-line tool that lets you communicate with Android devices using a Unix shell. With that connection up and running, you can run a variety of commands on the device.

#### Esper-Provisioned Android Devices

To connect with an Esper-provisioned Android device, navigate to Devices > Settings.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/DeviceSettings.png)

At the bottom of the page, click **ADB Access**.

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/ADBAccess.png)

To start you simply need to switch ADB to on:

![Reboot](./assets/NewConsole/ADB.png)

For security reasons, sessions are limited to 30 minutes. Simply establish a new session if you need more than 30 minutes.

#### Stock Android Devices

For stock Android devices, you will also need to open the device port for the Esper Agent running on the device to set up the secure connection to the Esper Platform.

You will need a PC running some form of terminal with Android Debug Bridge (ADB)—approving the permissions asked for on the device—and the Esper Command-Line Interface (CLI) installed on the PC you plan to use for your remote debugging session.

Connect the Android device to the PC using a USB cable and run the following command to enable ADB over TCP/IP:

*adb tcpip 5555*

The Android device should return the following:

*restarting in TCP mode port: 5555*

Enter the espercli command secureadb giving it the device ID for your debugging target. In this case the device ID is ESP-DMO-AZ40:

*espercli secureadb connect -d ESP-DMO-AZ40*

:::tip 
Be sure to first have the Esper CLI configured for your Esper Endpoint with the required Enterprise ID and a valid API key.
:::

The Android device should return the following:

*Initiating Remote ADB Session. This may take a few seconds…*

After a few seconds, the Android device should return the following. The endpoint address shown below will likely be different for your session:
 
*Secure ADB Client
Please connect ADB client to the following endpoint: 127.0.0.1 : 51556
If adb-tools is installed, please run the command below:
Adb connect 127.0.0.1:51556
Press Ctrl+C to quit!*
 
Switch to a new terminal window and start up your ADB connection using the IP address supplied by the secureadb command from the espercli:
 
*adb connect 127.0.0.1:51556*

You’ll get this message back:

*Connected to 127.0.0.1:51556*

You now have a secure remote ADB session with that device.

:::warning
Until the device is rebooted, you’ll be able to connect to the device remotely using Esper CLI. After rebooting, you’ll need to re-establish the ADB connection.
:::

## Groups

The **Groups** section enables you to assign devices to groups. Once devices are assigned to groups, you can use a single command to perform an action on all the devices in the group. You can, for example, apply a Compliance Policy to all the devices in the group at once.

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/GroupsTiles.png)

There is a "Default" group called where devices are automatically added unless otherwise specified during provisioning via template. It is also used as the collection point when devices are moved between groups.

### Creating a Group

You can create a Group by clicking **Create Group**. 

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/GroupCreateButton.png)

Enter a unique name in the text box and click **Create**. 

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/GroupCreateName.png)

The next step is to add devices to the group from the *Default group *(in this screen called *All devices*). This means you first have to remove any devices you want in the new group from any other group they are in to put them in the Default group. To move devices into your new group from the Default group, click the checkbox to the left of the names of the devices that need to be moved and click **Add Selected**, or for a single device once it is selected click on the + button that appears to the right.

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/GroupAddDevices.png)

Devices can be moved back to the Default Group by selecting the checkbox next to the device name and clicking on **Remove Selected**.

Once the desired devices have been moved to the Group, click **Save**.

You can also create a new group when creating a new Provisioning Template. In the Group section on the new template, you can create a group such that any device provisioned using the said template will fall in the newly created and selected group.

### Moving Devices Between Groups

Moving devices from one group to another group requires two steps:
   First remove the device or devices from the group they are in; this will move them to the Default group.
   Navigate to the destination group and add the devices from the Default group.

To remove one or more devices from a group, first click **View Details** for that group in the group’s tile:

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/GroupViewDetails.png)

Then click the ellipses on the left side of the screen and select Remove device.

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/GroupRemoveDevice.png)

Your screen is now in multi-select mode. Click on each device you wish to remove from the group.

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/GroupManageSelect.png)

Click on the **Remove selected devices** button in the bottom right hand corner. The following dialog will appear asking you to confirm the deletion.

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/GroupEventFeed.png)

Clicking on **More Details** next to one of the events listed will cause a sidebar to slide in from the right showing the status of the installation.

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/SetWIFIStateDetails.png)

### The Compliance Policy Tab

Compliance Policy lets you apply an existing compliance policy to all the devices in your group. You have two choices for how a Compliance Policy is applied to a Group: apply only to online devices, or queue them for offline devices to apply if they come online for 24 hours after the new policy has been applied.

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/GroupPolicy.png)

Select a previously created compliance policy from the **Select Policy** drop down, you can also search for policies by typing in the box. 

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/PolicySelect.png)

A preview of the chosen policy will appear below the box.

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/CompliancePolicyPreview.png)

When you apply a Compliance Policy to a group, all the online devices will receive a command to comply with the policy. If you select the checkbox next to, “Queue requests for offline devices,” the system will queue policy updates to be pushed to all offline devices that come back online within the next 24 hours. 

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/QueueRequests.png)

Click Apply policy to push the Compliance Policy out to the group. A slide out appears displaying the status of applying the new policy to the devices in the group.

### The Apps Tab

The Apps tab lets you manage the apps on all the devices in the group. This includes installing new apps, uninstalling apps, scheduling an app installation, and approving apps for the group.

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/GroupApps.png)

:::tip 
If you wish to update a currently installed app to a new version, you install that new version using any of the available means.
:::

:::tip
You cannot uninstall in-ROM apps (called Preloaded apps). Instead you can Disable these apps using Approvals.
:::

#### Install/Uninstall

The Apps section lets you install or uninstall both privately uploaded apps—also known as Enterprise Apps—and Google Play apps to the groups immediately. The action will only be performed on online devices. 

To install an app on all the devices in the group first select **Install/Uninstall**, then select **Install** from the **Select App Action** dropdown. 

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/GroupInstall.png)

Then select the app you’d like to install from the **Select App** dropdown. You can also type the first few letters of the app’s name into the search box to quickly find the app.

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/GroupInstallSelectApp.png)

Once you’ve selected an app, its details will appear in the **App Details Preview** section, including the app’s version, package name, and app type—that is, whether it’s an Enterprise app or a Google app.

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/GroupInstallApp.png)

Select a version from the Select Version dropdown and click Install. A sidebar will slide in from the right showing the status of the installation.

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/InstallSuccessDetails.png)

Group Uninstall works much the same. Simply select **Uninstall** rather than **Install** from the **Select App Action** dropdown. 

#### Scheduled Install

This section lets you schedule an app installation or uninstallation for a specific point in the future. To schedule an install or uninstall, first select **Schedule install**.

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/ScheduledInstall.png)

To schedule an app installation or uninstallation, click on the **Create scheduled install** button. You will be taken to a new screen where you enter the schedule details.

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/ScheduledInstallCreate1.png)

Enter a unique name for the scheduled installation or uninstallation in the Name field. Names cannot be reused. Select Install or Uninstall from the Select App Action dropdown.

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/GroupInstall.png)

Select the app you want to install or uninstall from the Select App dropdown.

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/GroupInstallSelectApp.png)

Use the radio buttons to choose between using the device’s time or your console’s time when scheduling an application installation or uninstallation for a group. If you select **Device time** when you schedule an app installation, the installation (or uninstallation) will be performed on the devices in that group whenever it’s the specified time on each device.

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/ScheduledInstallDeviceTime.png)

You also have the option to define a recurring schedule by selecting **Recurring schedule** — for instance, to schedule an application installation every Monday between 2:00 AM and 5:00 AM from May 1st to May 10th.

Select start and end dates from the Start Date and End Date dropdowns and start and stop times from the Start Time and End Time dropdowns. The click **Create Schedule**.

#### Approvals

The Approvals section enables you to show, hide or disable in-ROM apps (also referred to as Preloaded apps) on all the devices in the group.

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/GroupApprovals.png)

To change the approval status of an app, enter its package name in the box and click **Show, Hide**, or **Disable**.

Click **Apply**. The console will display the group command status.

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/SettingsActionStatus.png)

Clicking See Details will cause a sidebar to slide in from the right showing the status of the installation.

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/AppStateDetails.png)

:::tip 
You will need to enter the exact package name of any in-ROM apps you wish to show, hide, or delete. For example, Chrome’s package name is “com.android.chrome;” just entering “Chrome” or “Google Chrome” will not work.
:::

**Finding Package Names**

The best way to get the exact package name of an in-ROM app is to use an Android Debug Bridge (ADB) command to retrieve the names of all the packages.

Physically connect to the device using a USB cable and authorize ADB usage on the device by going to Device > Settings. Once ADB usage is authorized, the following command will retrieve the names of all the package names:
 
*adb shell pm list packages*
 
ADB will return a list of all the apps running on the device:

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/ADBCommands.png)

You can also view the package names for any apps installed on a device by viewing the device’s details and selecting Apps. The package name for each app is displayed in the resulting list view.

### OS Updates

The OS Updates section enables you to push operating-system updates to all the devices in the group that run Esper Enhanced Android.

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/GroupOSUpdates.png)

:::tip
The OS Updates section is only relevant for groups containing only Esper Enhanced Android devices.  
:::

To deploy an OS update to all the devices in a group, click **Deploy OS Updates**.

Click **Select Build** to select one of the available builds.

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/GroupNewInstall.png)

Click the radio button next to the build you want to deploy.

:::tip
Only the latest 30 builds of the Esper Enhanced Android updates will be available for deployment.
:::

![Groups](./assets/NewConsole/SelectBuild.png)

The **Number of Devices** field will populate with the devices in the group on which this update is applicable; that is, the number of devices that have an OS build version lower than the selected version for the deployment. Add the installation name and any pertinent notes and click Save.


## Apps

This section enables you to manage the applications used on the Android devices you manage. The devices you manage will only be able to install and use those apps you authorize. In most cases, device users won’t even be able to see anything else.

![Apps](./assets/NewConsole/AppsView.png)

There are two different types of Apps you can authorize on your Android devices:

   Enterprise Apps (APK files)
      You can upload Android Packages (APKs) for Enterprise apps to the Esper cloud; (APK is the package file format used by       the Android operating system for distribution and installation of mobile apps).
      
   Google Play Apps
      You can authorize—or disallow—apps from your managed Google Play store.
      
:::tip
You may approve in-ROM apps or Preloaded apps in a device from a Provisioning Template during provisioning by entering the package name in the Apps screen. You can also do so after provisioning using **Groups > Apps > Approvals**.
:::

### Uploading Enterprise Apps to the Esper Cloud

To upload an APK for a Enterprise app to the Esper cloud, click on Upload Apps in the top right corner of the screen. A popup box will appear into which you can drag the APK file for your Enterprise app; to select the file from your computer, click on Select APK.

![Apps](./assets/NewConsole/APKUpload.png)

Once uploaded, your Enterprise app will be shown under the “Uploaded Apps” section.

All app APK files must adhere to certain conditions to succeed uploading and provisioning:

   The APK must have a unique version name and number.
   The APK cannot be larger than 500 MB.
   The APK file itself must have the .apk extension.
   The APK file must include signature verification.
   The app cannot set itself as the default launcher; this will cause conflict with the Esper Agent (DPC).
   The app must adhere to the latest Android APK standards (currently we allow APKs without icons).		
   
If you attempt to upload an APK file that has a V2 or V3 signature, but not a V1 signature, it will be rejected. Older Android platforms—those running Marshmallow (6.0) and earlier—require v1 signatures.

Clicking on **View Details** on an app tile will show details for the app:
   App name
   Package name
   App icon
   Version code (for each version). Note that the same app can have various versions.
   App installed on - the number of devices the app is installed on
   Build number
   Size of the app
   Compatibility with SDK version
   Uploaded on — the date and time the app was uploaded to the Esper Cloud
   App description — an optional field for you to add a description or release notes
   
![Apps](./assets/NewConsole/AppDetails.png)

Clicking on the number of devices on which the app is installed will launch a popup window that provides a quick overview of the devices onto which the app has been installed and app version for each installation. Clicking on any device in the list will open a new tab with the device details for that device. 

![Apps](./assets/NewConsole/AppVersionDetails.png)

There is an ellipsis (...) under Actions. Clicking the ellipsis enables you to to:
   Delete the app version from the Esper Cloud
   Edit the description — You can add and edit description or release notes per version of the app
   Download the app version locally to your PC

![Apps](./assets/NewConsole/AppActions.png)

If you delete an app version from the Esper Cloud and the app is currently installed on a device or devices managed by Esper, the app will remain installed on the device or devices. However if the app version is included in one or more Provisioning Templates, it will be removed from each template when the app is deleted. If this is the case, you will need to confirm deletion of the app and it will then be removed from any associated Provisioning Templates.

![Apps](./assets/NewConsole/AppDelete.png)

A success toast will appear in the bottom left corner of your screen upon successful completion.

### Google Play

The Esper Console gives you access to Play for Work, the enterprise version of Google Play. Within Play for Work you can approve apps, which can then be downloaded onto your GMS devices (AOSP devices are not supported by Google Play). If you give device users access to the Google Play Store app on the device, you can limit installable apps from the Play Store to only to those approved through Esper. Note that Google Play is a service provided by Google, Esper does not control the user experience for Google Play.

#### Signing Up for Play for Work

If you have not signed up for Play for Work to create a managed Google Play account for your Esper Endpoint, you’ll see the following when you click on **Apps > Google Play**.

![Apps](./assets/NewConsole/AppsPlayStore.png)

:::danger
You will need a Gmail account to create your managed Google Play account. You can not use a G Suite account. A best practice is to use a dedicated Gmail account for this purpose.
:::

Click on the enroll button and you’ll be taken to a Google’s managed Google Play sign up page. Click **SIGN IN**.

![Apps](./assets/NewConsole/GooglePlay1.png)

Sign into the Gmail account you intend to use for enrollment.

:::tip
If you are already signed into a G-suite account you will see a slightly different screen telling you to choose a non-G Suite account to continue. Just copy the URL, open a new Incognito window, and go to the URL. You should now see the **SIGN IN** button. You can then use an existing Gmail account or create a new one as needed.
:::

Fill in the information requested by Google, including your company name. Provide the contact information for your Data Protection Officer and / or EU Representative, or leave blank if they don’t apply. Check the box for the agreement, and click **Confirm**.

Click **Complete Registration**.

![Apps](./assets/NewConsole/GPlaySetup.png)

You’ll be taken back to your Esper Endpoint. If you used an Incognito window, you’ll need to log into your Endpoint. If you’re already logged in, you’ll see a screen in Esper indicating enrollment is in process.

![Apps](./assets/NewConsole/EnrollingScreen.png)

Once the process completes, you’ll have Play Store apps available to use with your GMS devices on Esper.

![Apps](./assets/NewConsole/PlayStore-Apps.png)

#### Approving a Google Play Store App

The Esper Console gives you access to Play for Work, the enterprise version of Google Play. Within Play for Work you can approve apps, which can then be downloaded onto your devices. You can also unapprove apps, which will then cease to be visible or available in the Google Play store on your devices.
To approve a Google Play app, click on **Google Play**.

In the popup box that appears, click on **Approve**.

![Apps](./assets/NewConsole/GooglePlayApprove.png)

Select the radio button next to the way you would like to handle new app permission requests. Selecting Keep approved results in the best user experience as the user will not have to grant any new permissions on the device, however you need to be sure you trust the app provider if you choose this option. If  you’d like to receive email notification whenever an app requests new permissions, click on the Notifications tab and add your email address in the space provided. Then click **Done**.

![Apps](./assets/NewConsole/GoogleAppApproval.png)

:::tip
Be sure the app supports the appropriate minimum API level for the GMS devices you wish to deploy the app to, and that you are in a supported country for the app. If either of these are mismatched, Google Play will prevent installation of the app onto non-conforming devices either during provisioning or while installing from Esper.
:::

#### Installing Google Play Apps

Once you have approved a Google Play app, GMS device users will be able to download it from the Google Play Store if you’ve provisioned your devices with Google Play available to users. You can also install the app to a group of devices in **Groups**, or to a single device in **Devices**.

Alternatively you can also install it on a single device device in **Apps** by clicking on the tile for the app giving you access to additional install options.

## Compliance Policy

A Compliance Policy is a set of rules or permissions related to the device configurations that can be applied to devices managed by Esper. The Compliance Policy section enables you to create a policy that sets these parameters. 

![CompliancePolicy](./assets/NewConsole/CompliancePolicy.png)

The **Compliance Policy** section lists all the policies that have already been created. 
You have four options with these, indicated by the four icons to the right of each compliance policy listing.

![CompliancePolicy](./assets/NewConsole/Actions.png)

The options are:
   Duplicate the Policy (two pages icon)
      Clicking this icon duplicates an existing compliance policy so you can use it as the basis for a new policy.
   View the Policy (eye icon)
      Clicking this icon lets you view an existing compliance policy.
   Edit the Policy (pencil icon)
      Clicking this icon lets you make changes to an existing compliance policy. Once the policy has been applied to a device       or devices, it cannot be changed and this option will be greyed out.
   Delete the Policy (garbage can icon)
      Clicking this icon deletes a policy.
   
Use Search to find an already created Compliance Policy by Policy name.

### Creating a New Compliance Policy

To create a new Compliance Policy, click New Policy. This will bring up a screen in which you can set all the configurations of the new Compliance Policy. The layout is the same as when you [define a Compliance Policy in a Provisioning Template], but uniquely includes the name and description.

![CompliancePolicy](./assets/NewConsole/CreatePolicy.png)

**Enter a Policy Name and Description**

Enter a unique name for your new compliance policy in the Policy Name field; enter an optional description in the Description field.

![CompliancePolicy](./assets/NewConsole/CompPolicyCreate.png)

**Lock Screen Password Rules**

The Lock screen password rule specifies the conditions for the device unlock password, with the default being None.

![CompliancePolicy](./assets/NewConsole/LockScreenPwd.png)

If you choose alphabetic or alphanumeric, you must set a minimum password length of at least 4 characters and up to 25—use the small up/down arrows to set your required password length:

![CompliancePolicy](./assets/NewConsole/LockPwdLength.png)

**Alphabetic**: Restricts acceptable password to only upper and lowercase alphabetic characters (A to Z, and a to z).
**Alphanumeric**: Expands acceptable password to include numbers, and special characters in addition to alphabetic characters.
**None**: There is no password required to unlock the device.

The password for a device will be set up during the initial setup of the device by the user.

Lock screen must be on in order to set Lock screen password rules. If you select either Alphabetic or Alphanumeric password rules, then Lock screen will be set to On by Esper if it is currently Off.

**Default App Permission**

Default app permissions determine enforcement of the runtime-permission rule across all the apps on a device including Enterprise apps installed by Esper, in-ROM apps that are enabled, as well as any installed via Managed Google Play. This ensures you can control the user experience on the device regarding how run-time permissions are granted.

![CompliancePolicy](./assets/NewConsole/TemplateAppPermission.png)

There are three possible settings:

**Allow Automatically**: This rule will grant all the permissions any app requests without showing a prompt to the user. This is the typical setting used for single-purpose solutions using a fully trusted, customer-supplied application.

**Ask User**: This keeps the default behavior intact with regards to permission management. All apps on the device will show a prompt to the user to request permission. For example, by choosing this option then every app will ask the user each time before accessing a device module with a message such as “Allow app X to access Gallery? Allow/Deny”. This may be unsuitable for some solutions, especially Kiosk-based apps. It can be useful for certain unusual situations dealing with App permissions—contact us directly to find out more.

**Deny Automatically**: This rule will deny any permission request from any app on the device. No notification will be shown to the user. You can grant permissions to apps individually from the Esper Console.

**System Updates**

The System updates option allows you to enforce a system update policy on the device when a system update is available via the device’s over-the-air (OTA) update service.

![CompliancePolicy](./assets/NewConsole/TemplateSysUpdates.png)

There are four possible settings:

**Update automatically**: This option will install any over-the-air (OTA) updates automatically as soon as they become available without user interaction,  and reboot the devices when necessary.
**Postpone installation**: This option postpones installation of an OTA update for 30 days. After 30 days, the system will prompt the device user to install the update. Subsequent updates will also follow the same 30-day postponement. This is ideal when you need time to validate your solution against new system updates before they are installed.
**Windowed Installation**: This option allows you to define a window of time during which the OTA update will be installed without user interaction. This option is ideal for devices with a known down period. A drop-down will appear to enable you to set the start and end times for the maintenance window.
**Disable Update**: This option allows you to disable updates on the device. It is available for a limited set of OTA services that support this feature. If the device does not support disabling updates, it will default to Postpone installation. Before setting this option please contact Esper directly to make sure the devices you plan to provision support this configuration.

**Android Settings App**

Android settings app determines how users can access the Android device settings.

![CompliancePolicy](./assets/NewConsole/AndroidSettingsApp.png)

There are three possible settings:

**System settings app**: This setting will display the icon for the default Android settings app on the Home screen. Clicking this icon will take the user to the default Android settings. Depending on the other configurations set by the Compliance Policy, some options may be disabled to the user. If an app is set up in Kiosk mode on the device, the System settings app will be inaccessible to the device user while the app is in Kiosk mode.

**None**: No icon for any settings app will be available for the user to choose from the device’s Home screen.

**Esper settings app**: Esper offers a custom settings app that gives device users access to a subset of the available Android settings when servicing a device. The Esper settings app is intended for use by technicians servicing a device locally. It’s protected by the Dock & Esper Settings App password to prevent unauthorized access. This app offers a reduced number of settings:
   Wi-Fi: Change the Wi-Fi access point used by the device.
   Torch: Turn on the Torch (AKA “flashlight”) if the device has a camera flash LED.
   Auto-Rotation: Turn auto-rotation on or off.
   Factory Reset: Perform a factory reset of the device, regardless of the Compliance Policy applied. 
   Kiosk App: Change the app that runs in kiosk mode. The device user can choose any installed app on the device to act as       the kiosk app, with the Esper Console kept in sync on the configuration stats.
   Esper Branding: Turn off the Esper logo on the Home screen.
   About: Supplies information regarding the endpoint name the device is enrolled in, in case the customer has access to multiple Esper endpoints.
   
   ![CompliancePolicy](./assets/NewConsole/EsperSettingsApp.png)
    
**Dock & Empty Settings App Password**

The dock is specifically for devices in Kiosk mode. When a device is in kiosk mode, you can access the dock by tapping 3 times in the upper left corner of the screen, or by pressing the power button consecutively 3 times with a slight pause between each press. When you do so, an expander arrow will slide out of the upper right corner:

Tap the expander arrow; you’ll need to enter the password you set in the Compliance Policy.

![CompliancePolicy](./assets/NewConsole/DeviceAppSlider.jpg)

Once you’ve entered the password, a dock will slide out that gives you three options:
   Exit Kiosk mode. If the device is in multi-app mode, no action is taken.
   Reboot the device.
   Open the  Esper Settings app; selecting the Esper Settings app will require you to enter the password again to gain access.

To slide the dock back in, click on the expander arrow again; it will disappear after a few seconds.

:::tip
If you exit Kiosk mode into multi-app mode, you can still activate the expander arrow by pressing the power button 3 times to ensure you can put the device back into Kiosk mode locally even if the Esper Settings app was not included on the Home screen.
:::

**Dock and Esper Settings App Password**

 This password controls access to the hidden dock available in kiosk mode, the Esper Settings app, and serves as the PIN used for IMEI-based provisioning via AfW. The password is alphanumeric and can be from 1 to 10 characters.

![CompliancePolicy](./assets/NewConsole/DockEsperSettingsPassword.png)

The default password is 1234. It is possible to set up a template without a password for these features, or just leave the default password; Esper strongly recommends setting up a more complex password for stronger security. The same password will be set for all devices provisioned using the template.

:::tip 
If your device is set up in Kiosk mode, the dock will be accessible even if you choose either no settings app or the Android settings app as part of your applied Compliance Policy. That means you should set an appropriate password for the Dock & Esper Settings app if you plan to deploy your devices in Kiosk mode.
:::

**Google Account Restrictions**

This setting enables you to restrict the number of Google accounts that can be added on the device and used with Google apps like Gmail, Google Play Store, and YouTube. By default, any number of accounts can be added to a specific device; this setting restricts this number. For example, if you set this setting to two, only two accounts will be permitted on the device, further addition (or deletion) of accounts will not be possible unless a different Compliance policy is reapplied.

If you don’t check the Google account restrictions box and plan to provision your device in Multi application mode, we recommend disabling Google Play Store to prevent installation of unapproved apps.

:::tip
The Google Account Restriction feature is applicable only to Google Mobile Services (GMS) Android devices. If you include the Android Settings App and wish to prevent any Google accounts from being added, set Number of accounts to 0.
:::

**Factory Reset Protection** 

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) enables you to lock a device if a user factory resets it via soft/hard keys on GMS devices. In case of a factory reset, the device will get locked and can only be unlocked by entering a pre-authorized google account ID. Additional information about how to get your Google Account ID is available in the Compliance Policy section.

When you turn on the FRP button, you’ll need to enter the Google ID of the account you want to use to authorize post factory resets on the devices provisioned with this template.

![CompliancePolicy](./assets/NewConsole/SettingsFactoryReset.png)

:::tip
This feature is only available on GMS devices running Android 5.1 and above.
:::

**Lock Screen**

If Lock Screen is on, it enables the default “lock screen” to be displayed upon a screen timeout as specified in the Settings section. If this is on, the device user will have the option to set the password. If Lock screen password rules are defined, the device user will be required to enter a password that conforms with these rules.

**Safe-Mode Login**

When Safe-mode login is on, users will be able to boot to Safe Mode on their device; when Safe-mode login is off, users will be unable to boot to Safe Mode.

**Factory Reset**

Factory Reset controls whether or not the user can perform a factory reset on the device using the Android Settings app. When Factory Reset is off, the user will not be able to perform a factory reset on the device. This does not prevent a hard-key factory reset, see Factory Reset Protection to prevent hard-key factory reset.

**Notification Bar**

If you want device users to be able to swipe down to see the notification bar, set Notification Bar to on. If you don’t, set it to off. You will typically want this off for Kiosk mode-based solutions. 
Conversely in most cases a user is required to submit a Bug Report that was requested through Esper via the Notification Bar, thus inaccessible with the Notification Bar turned off.

**Screenshot**

If you want device users to be able to take screenshots, set Screenshot to On. If you don’t, set it to Off. This will prevent users from initiating a screenshot using the appropriate hardkey sequence or available softkey on the device.

**USB Connectivity**

USB connectivity allows users to connect USB devices—things like flash drives, digital cameras, mice, or keyboards—to the device. If you want device users to be able to connect other hardware to the device, set USB Connectivity to on. If you don’t, set it to off.

**SMS**

SMS controls the ability of the device to send or receive text messages via short-message service (SMS). If it is turned Off, the device will not send or receive text messages regardless of which SMS app is used. Set SMS to on if you wish to enable the device to send and receive text messages via SMS.

**Outgoing Calls**

If you want device users to be able to make outgoing calls, set Outgoing Calls to on. If you don’t, set it to off.

**Camera Access**

If you want device users to be able to use the camera, set Camera Access to on. If you don’t, set it to off.

:::tip
Your app will still be able to access the camera if this setting is set to off.
:::

**NFC**

If you want device users to be able to use near-field communication (NFC) on their devices—on those devices that support NFC—set NFC to on; if you don’t, set it to off. If any of your apps require NFC, make sure this setting is set to on.

**Google Play Store**

If you want device users to have access to your Managed Google Play Store, set the Google Play Store setting to On; if you don’t, set it to Off. You’ll still be able to install any approved Google Play Store apps from Esper onto the device. This only applies to GMS devices, as AOSP devices do not include Google Play Store support.

**USB Tethering**

USB tethering specifies if the user is able to use their device to share a mobile connection to another device such as a laptop. If you’d like device users to let their devices share a mobile connection with other devices, set the USB tethering to On; if you don’t, set it to Off.

**Edit Date and Time**
If you’d like device users to be able to set the date and time on the device, set the Edit Date and Time setting to On; if you don’t set it to Off.

**Application Uninstall**

Setting Application uninstall to On will block app uninstallation both locally on the device and using Esper. Set it to off if you need to be able to uninstall applications remotely using Esper. 

:::tip
With this set to on you will still be able to update your application installed on the device using Esper.
:::

**USB File Transfer**

If you’d like device users to be able to transfer files to or from the device using a USB cable or flash drive, set USB file transfer to On; if you don’t, set it to Off.

**Google Assistant**

If you’d like device users to be able to use voice command via Google Assistant on devices where this is supported, set Google Assistant to On; if you don’t, set it to Off.

:::tip
On a few devices, this setting may need to be on if you wish to have Google Play Store show up on the device. 
:::

**Local App Install**

This feature allows installation of apps from unknown sources on the device. To enable this on the device, the user needs to follow these instructions. Settings >Apps and Notifications > Special App Permissions> Install Unknown Apps and choose the route they wish to install the apps from. For example, if the device user chooses Chrome, they will be able to download and install apps from the Chrome browser on the device. If turned off, the device user will not be allowed to install apps from any unknown sources.

**Restrict Incoming and Outgoing Calls**

Selecting the checkbox next to Restrict outgoing/incoming calls using customised dialer opens up two more checkboxes:
   Restrict incoming calls to uploaded contacts only
   Restrict outgoing calls to uploaded contacts only
   
![CompliancePolicy](./assets/NewConsole/TemplateCustomDialer.png)

Selecting either or both of these checkboxes will restrict incoming or outgoing calls to a specific list of telephone numbers, which you need to then upload to the device using a .csv file.

:::tip 
All numbers must be preceded by +country code (for example +1 for US). All numbers must be separated by comma.
:::

### ADB

Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is a command-line tool that enables developers to use a Unix shell to communicate with an Android device. If the ADB option is checked in the device’s Compliance Policy, you may turn on ADB via **Devices > Device > Settings** for a configurable time period. If the ADB option is unchecked in the Compliance Policy, ADB can not be turned on from Settings. Most stock Android devices will require opening the port on the device for the Esper agent to set up a secure connection to the Esper Cloud for ADB debugging. You can find out more about using ADB with Esper [here].

:::tip
We never allow turning on ADB from the device on any Esper-provisioned device.
:::

### Resetting to Default Settings

You may reset these values to default at any time by clicking the Reset to Default button at the bottom of this panel.
When you are satisfied with your compliance settings, click **Next**.

### Duplicating a Compliance Policy

If you’d like to base a new Compliance Policy on an existing Compliance Policy, click on the copy icon (two boxes) in the Compliance Policy list view. A duplicate will be made you can then edit, rename, and modify as needed.

![CompliancePolicy](./assets/NewConsole/CompliancePolicyCopy.png)

### Editing a Compliance Policy

If you’d like to edit an existing Compliance Policy, click on the Edit icon (pencil) in the Compliance Policy list view.

![CompliancePolicy](./assets/NewConsole/CompliancePolicyEdit.png)

NOTE: When a Compliance Policy has already been applied to devices, it can’t be edited, and the icon will be grayed out on the menu.

![CompliancePolicy](./assets/NewConsole/CompPolicyMessage.png)

## Reports
Your Esper Console provides reports on the performance of the devices and groups of devices it manages. The Reports section explains how these reports work and how they can be customized to better meet your needs.

![Report](./assets/NewConsole/Reports.png)

### Daily Reports

Esper automatically generates a daily report for your fleet. The **Reports** section lists the available **Daily Reports**, with the most recent reports being at the top of the list. To view a Daily Report, click on the **View** icon in line with its listing or click on Daily Reports under Report type. To download a Daily Report in a CSV file format, click the **Download** icon in line with its listing.

![Report](./assets/NewConsole/DailyReports.png)

The Daily Report lists the following information:
   Number of Registered devices, e.g. devices provisioned on your endpoint
   Peak number of active devices
   Number of newly provisioning devices, e.g. within the last 3 days

For each group, it also lists: 
   Number of Registered devices
   Number of Active devices
   Number of Inactive devices
   Newly provisioned devices

Clicking > next to one of the groups will give you additional detail about the devices in that group: 

![Report](./assets/NewConsole/ReportDetails.png)

This view lists the following details per device - 
   Device name
   Serial number
   Status
   Registered on
   Location as of the report date
   Whether or not the device has recently changed location
   Brand
   Model
   Any tags assigned to the device
   
This information can also be downloaded as a .pdf file, an Excel spreadsheet, or a .csv file by clicking **Download** and selecting a file format from the dropdown menu.

![Report](./assets/NewConsole/ReportDownloadType.png)

### Custom Reports

You can generate custom reports that cover a specific period of time. To generate a custom report, click the Custom Reports tab.

![Report](./assets/NewConsole/ReportsCustom.png)

Select the device group you want to be covered by the report from the Select Device Group dropdown menu. Click the Start Date box to enter the beginning of the reporting period. Click the End Date box to enter the end of the reporting period. Then click Generate Report.

![Report](./assets/NewConsole/ReportsCustomConfigure.png)

This Custom Report will contain the same information as the Daily Report, but it will cover the specified time period and groups.

![Report](./assets/NewConsole/ReportDaily.png)

### Subscribing to Reports

You can subscribe via email to the reports automatically generated by the system. To subscribe, click the Email subscription button at the top right of the Reports window.

![Report](./assets/NewConsole/ReportsEmailSubscription.png)

The **Email subscription** pane will slide in from the right. Enter the email addresses for any users into the Enter your email ID field. You can enter multiple email addresses into the field; simply use commas to separate them. Then click **Subscribe**.

![Report](./assets/NewConsole/ReportsEmail.png)

To unsubscribe users from the daily report email, click on the checkboxes next to the email address in the **Subscribers** list and click **Unsubscribe**. You can unsubscribe all email addresses by selecting the **Subscribers** checkbox at the top of the list and clicking **Unsubscribe**.

There are some limitations to the report email subscription service:
   A maximum of ten subscriptions can be done for each endpoint.
   Duplicate email addresses are not allowed.
   All subscriptions will be subjected to an automated check for invalid email address format and for invalid domains.


## Geofence

Geofencing lets you use a device’s location—generated by GPS—to trigger an alert when the device enters or leaves a defined area. Geofencing enables you to make sure a fleet of delivery devices stay in their delivery zone, warehousing devices don’t stray far from the warehouse, and restaurant ordering devices don’t leave the restaurant.

In order for geofencing to work, the mobile device needs internet connectivity and location services enabled. Thus geofencing is typically used for cellular-connected devices with high accuracy location services enabled—whether smartphones or tablets.

![Geofence](./assets/NewConsole/GeofenceLockdown.png)

Any geofencing you have set up will be shown in list view. If you prefer to see them as tiles, click on the Tile View icon.

![Geofence](./assets/NewConsole/GeofenceSummary.png)

To look at an existing geofence, click on its name in the list. This will bring up an overview of the geofence.

![Geofence](./assets/NewConsole/GeofenceMapView.png)

To view the devices on the fence—that is, the devices subject to that geofence—click Devices on Fence.

![Geofence](./assets/NewConsole/GeofenceSuccess.png)

To unassign devices from the Geofence, click the ellipsis (...) next to that device’s entry on the list and click Unapply from the pop-up box. Devices that haven't been successfully assigned to the group can be assigned using the same method.

### Setting Up a Geofence

To set up a geofence, click on **New Geofence**.

![Geofence](./assets/NewConsole/GeofenceNew.png)

Enter the address for the center of the circle in the **Location** field; the map will adjust to center the address. Use the slider to set the radius of the geofence. The geofence is a circle; its radius can be as small as 100 meters and as large as 10 kilometers. Note that GPS can drift and jump, thus a geofence smaller than 100m can cause false positives. Enter a name and description in the appropriate fields and click **Next**.

![Geofence](./assets/NewConsole/GeofenceMap.png)

Click the check box next to each device you’d like to assign to this geofence and click Next.

![Geofence](./assets/NewConsole/GeofenceAssignDevices.png)

To define the action to be taken whenever a device leaves the geofence, click Lock Devices, Beep, or both and click Create.

![Geofence](./assets/NewConsole/GeofenceActions.png)

If you chose to Lockdown the device, the user will see the following screen if the device is taken outside the geofence boundary:

![Geofence](./assets/NewConsole/DeviceGeofence.png)

:::tip
The performance of Geofencing is dependent on the accuracy of the GPS built into the devices. Additionally, ability to track location of the device is also dependent on Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular connectivity, and internet connectivity of the device. This feature is not supported for Android version 4.x.
:::

## Pipeline

Esper Pipeline enables you to ensure smooth completion of actions on large fleets of devices by providing a way to automate them. Using a pipeline you define the stages through which the actions must go and the events that trigger each of those stages, providing an effective way to control complex or large processes.

Esper Pipeline currently only supports app installation and requires a break of 5 or more seconds between the completion of one state and the triggering of the next.

![Pipeline](./assets/NewConsole/PipelineSummary.png)

Pipeline lets you specify any number of stages or operations for automating a given task—reducing the manual work to do so step by step.

![Pipeline](./assets/NewConsole/PipelinePreview.png)

### Creating a Pipeline

To create a new pipeline, click on **New Pipeline**.

![Pipeline](./assets/NewConsole/PipelineNew.png)

Enter a name for your new pipeline in the Name your pipeline field. Enter a description in the Add description field. Then click **Next**.

![Pipeline](./assets/NewConsole/PipelineCreate.png)

Select the trigger that will set your pipeline in motion from the **Select the trigger** dropdown menu. Any time the defined trigger occurs—through the dashboard, through an API call, or through a CLI command—the pipeline will automatically start running. For V1 we currently only support the trigger where a new Enterprise app version is uploaded to the Esper Cloud. 

Select the app you would like to use as a trigger from the Select the app dropdown menu and click **Next**.

![Pipeline](./assets/NewConsole/PipelineTrigger.png)

Next, define the stages your pipeline will go through once triggered. For each state, give a name and description, then add the operations that are to take place. For each operation, you then need to give a name and description, an operation type, and select a group of devices on which the operation will occur.

Currently these operations are limited to uninstalling apps.

You can create any number of stages to accommodate the process you are automating. When your pipeline is complete, click on **See Preview**.

![Pipeline](./assets/NewConsole/PipelineAddStage.png)

![Pipeline](./assets/NewConsole/PipelineStage.png)

If your pipeline is ready, click **Done**.

Your pipeline can be edited later as necessary.

![Pipeline](./assets/NewConsole/PipelinePreview.png)

### Editing a Pipeline

To edit an existing pipeline, click the ellipsis (...) on its tile and select Edit from the popup.

![Pipeline](./assets/NewConsole/PipelineActions.png)

### Deleting a Pipeline

To delete a pipeline, click the ellipsis (...) on its tile and select Delete from the popup.

![Pipeline](./assets/NewConsole/PipelineActions.png)

## Company Settings

The Company Settings section displays your company’s information. You can edit your company’s information by clicking on the Edit Profile button at the top right of the screen.

![Company Settings](./assets/NewConsole/CompanySettings.png)

Please enter the following:
   Registered name
   Location
   Name
   Zip code
   Email
   Address
   Phone number

### Company Short Code for Device ID

The Company Settings tab also enables you to enter two 3-letter codes called the short code intended for your company name and location, but how you use them are up to you. These will be used as the prefix to name all the devices you control in Esper.

![Company Settings](./assets/NewConsole/CompanyShortCode.png)

In this example, ESP is a three-letter abbreviation for our company, Esper, and DOC signifies the documentation team.

Once you’ve entered all the information, click on **Save**.

:::tip
If you change your short code after you’ve provisioned devices, those devices will display the old short code prefix on the device but the new short code will be displayed in the Esper Console and also be used for API, SDK, and CLI calls. Thus it is best to change to your desired short code before you provision any devices.
:::

## Esper Enhanced Updates

Esper Enhanced Android devices are devices that are shipped with a customized Android OS that delivers improved security, faster deployment, superior debugging, and a better user experience for single-purpose devices.

![EEA](./assets/NewConsole/EEA.png)

If you’re using Esper Enhanced Android devices, you can update the operating systems on your devices using our over-the-air (OTA) functionality. To deploy a new available build on a group, navigate to **Group > OS Update**. See the Group section for more details.

:::tip
Currently only the latest thirty builds of Esper Enhanced Android updates will be listed and available for deployment.
:::

## API Key Management

Esper is focused on helping developers build, deliver, and maintain dedicated-device applications—whether a restaurant kiosk, retail POS, or logistics hub. We have made our APIs available to developers worldwide so they can move repetitive app and device management actions into reusable code. The API key (along with the Enterprise ID) is required to use our Cloud API, Device SDK, Python SDK, and CLI. We also offer the Esper Plugin for the Android Studio with tools improving the challenging task of app diagnostics—including working with deployed apps running on dedicated devices in the field.

### Generating an API Key

The first step in interacting with our API is to generate an API key you can tie to it. Do this by clicking **Register App**.

You can also easily copy the Enterprise ID, necessary for API calls, by clicking on the copy icon next to Enterprise ID on top right of this section.

![API](./assets/NewConsole/APIKeyManagementRegister.png)

Enter a unique app name and description (optional) and click **Register Application**.

![API](./assets/NewConsole/AppRegister.png)

Click **Generate Token**. This will generate a unique OAuth-based API key.

![API](./assets/NewConsole/AuthAccessTokenGenerate.png)

You can then copy (or renew if needed) your API key. API keys need to be renewed every 3 months.

![API](./assets/NewConsole/AuthAccessToken.png)

You will need your API key and Enterprise ID to access our [CLI platform] as well as to use the [SDK/API] in your development and management systems.

You can find additional information about this process by clicking on [Developer Hub] and [API Documentation].

:::tip
An API key is tied to the user account used to create the key. If you delete a user via User management, then any API keys associated with that user will also be deleted and will be immediately invalidated for API, SDK, and CLI use. To avoid the situation where API keys are unintendedly deleted when a user account is deleted, a best practice is to create a specific user account just for API key management. The Enterprise ID is specific to your endpoint and does not change.
