## Manage Home

This page explains the functionality of the Esper Home Dashboard.

There are four tile sections on the Home Dashboard page:

### 1\. Deployment Status

This tile shows the current deployment status of the devices for the current customer environment and includes a clickable link to number of Active, Inactive, Under Provisioning and Recently Added devices. Clicking on each takes the user to the [Device Dashboard](./console/device-management/index.md) showing the corresponding category of devices.

### 2\. Security Summary

The Security Summary tile shows a summary of security status of the deployed devices. It shows how many of them are at High Risk, Medium Risk, Low Risk and No Risk. Clicking on each takes the user to the [Device Dashboard](./console/device-management/index.md) showing the corresponding category of devices.

### 3\. Where are your Devices?

This section gives an overview of the location where all the devices are deployed. You can see a world map showing locations of all the devices in Map and Satellite View. It can be made full screen and user has options to zoom in and zoom out. There is also a summary of cities worldwide containing the highest number of devices.

### 4\. Alerts Status

The Alerts Status tile gives a summary of Alerts you've created and Alerts that have been fired for each of the created Alerts. The Alert name can be selected from the dropdown and the number of Alerts fired will then be shown.

## Provision Device

Provisioning is the initial step to configuring and managing your Android device using the Esper Management Console and associated developer tools.

Esper provides multiple methods of provisioning a device, which involves downloading the Esper Agent onto the device and configuring it according to the provisioning settings used for a Device Template. The supported provisioning methods are:

1.  [AFW provisioning](./console/device-provisioning/afw-provisioning/index.md) - AFW (Android for Work) method is best used for:

    * Devices that have GMS (Google Mobile Services) enabled
    * Devices with a camera for QR code scanning

2.  [ADB provisioning](./console/device-provisioning/adb-provisioning/index.md) - ADB (Android Debug Bridge) method is best used for:

    * Devices with No Google Services
    * Devices with No camera
    * Devices running Android 6.0, 5.1 or 4.4

3.  [IMEI (or Serial Number) based provisioning](./console/device-provisioning/imei-or-serial-number-based-provisioning/index.md)

    * IMEI/Serial Number method is use for Bulk provisioning of devices
    * Enables zero touch provisioning

4.  [QR Code Provisioning](./console/device-provisioning/qr-code-provisioning/index.md)
    * QR Method like AFW is used for devices that have both GMS (Google Mobile Services) and Camera enabled

## Device Template

### How to use Esper's Device Template.

Device Template is a one stop means for you to quickly provision your device. It lets you create a profile for the device where you may choose the policy, apps, device settings, Device Group, and the wallpapers that you want to be provisioned on the device. Device Templates can be created, saved, and used to provision at a later point.

### Steps to create a Device Template.

1.  Click on 'Device Template'.
2.  Click on 'Create Template'.
3.  Enter a name for the Device Template. Click `Next`.

![Device Template](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/1_DT.png)

### In the Policy section

Policy is a standard set of rules or permissions that are related to security of the devices and apps that admin can apply on the devices to be provisioned via template. Admin may set default app permissions, Android setting app, system updates, password rules, and turn on the toggle buttons for the settings he/she wishes to enable on the devices.

Below is a list of features you can turn on or off in the policy section. These are part of our standard Compliance policy that can be configured and reapplied as per requirements of the customer after provisioning.

### Dropdown menus

1.  **Device Password Rules** \
    If you choose alphabetic or alphanumeric, a minimum password length can be entered. The default minimum password length is 4.
    The Password rule is a policy that specifies the rules for the device unlock password that users can set.
    * **Alphabetic**: Restricts acceptable password to contain only alphabetic characters (A to Z) in both upper and lower case.

    * **Alphanumeric**: Expands from Alphabetic to also include numbers and special characters.

    * **None**: There is no password required to lock the device.

    The password for a device is setup during the initial setup of the device by the user.

2.  **Default App Permission** \
    Default app permissions determines enforcement of the runtime-permission rule across all the apps on a device (e.g. Gallery, Camera).

    * **Allow automatically**: This rule will grant all the permissions any app requests without showing a prompt to the user.

    * **Ask user**: This keeps the default behavior intact with regards to permission management. All apps on the device will show a prompt to the user to request permission. For example, by choosing this option then every app will ask the user each time before accessing a device module with a message such as “Allow app X to access Gallery? Allow/Deny”

    * **Deny automatically**: This rule will deny any permission request from any app on the device.<br/>

3.  **System Updates** \
    The System updates option allows you to enforce a system update policy on the device when a system update/OTA update is available.

    * **Update automatically**: Enforcing this rule will install any OTA update automatically and reboot the device without requesting the user.

    * **Postpone installation**: This option postpones installation of an OTA update for 30 days.

    * **Windowed installation**: This option allows you to define a time window during a full day period inside which the OTA update will be installed.

     <br/>

4.  **Android Settings App** \
    Android settings app determines how users can access the Android device settings.

    * **Default setting app**: Selecting this will show the icon for the default Android settings app. Clicking this icon will take the user to the default Android settings.

    * **No settings app**: No icon for any settings app will be available for the user to choose from the device’s dashboard.

    * **Esper settings app**: Esper offers a custom Settings’ app that limits the user to only a subset of the available Android settings. Settings provided via this app are limited to:
        1. Changing the Wi-Fi AP

        2. Enabling the “flashlight” if there’s a camera flash LED on the device

        3. Control the display orientation of the device.

    * **Contact Esper** to setup a password for the Esper Settings app.

    <br/>

### Factory Reset Protection <Badge text="New" type="tip"/>

FRP or Factory Reset Protection enables you to lock your device if a user tries to factory reset it via soft/hard keys. In case of a factory reset, the device will get locked and will only be reusable by a pre-authorized google account ID. See Policy section in docs to know how to get your google account id. Note that this feature is only available on android versions 5 and above. <br>

![Factory Reset Protection](./assets/GoogleAccountid/factory_reset_protection.png)

On turning on the FRP button, user needs to enter the Google ID of the account they wish to authorize to enable usage of the device post factory reset. <br/>

See [here](./console/policy-management/getgoogleaccount.md) to know how to get the Google account ID of your account and how FRP protects your device.

Other Template Compliance Policy Toggle Buttons-<br>

15. **USB File transfer** <br> Turning off USB file transfer will prevent the user from transferring files from the device to a computer and vice versa using a USB cable<br/>
16. **Google Assistant** <Badge text="New" type="tip"/> <br> Enables/disables voice command via Google Assistant. Available only for Android devices supporting Google Assistant. For example - If you wish to have Google Play Store show up on the device, you may turn on the toggle button. <br> <br/>

### Restrict outgoing/incoming calls using customised dialer.

If clicked, this opens up two more checkboxes-<br>

1.  `Restrict incoming calls to uploaded contacts only <upload a csv file of allowed contacts>`<br>
2.  `Restrict outgoing calls to uploaded contacts only <upload a csv file of allowed contacts>`<br> In order to restrict phone numbers that can make or receive calls to the device, upload a .csv file with the allowed phone numbers.<br>

:::tip
All numbers must be preceded by +country code (for example +1 for US). All numbers must be separated by comma.
:::
<br> <br/> ![Device Template](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/newpolicytemplate.png) <br> <br/> You may reset these values to default at any time by clicking `Reset to Default` button at the bottom. <br> <br/> Click `Next`. <br> <br/>

### In the Apps section

Select 'Kiosk mode' to pin an app during startup or 'Multi application mode' to give users access to the Home screen. Choose the apps that you would like to have installed on your device during provisioning. You may choose from install apps you uploaded via [App Management](./console/app-management/index.md) or install apps from Google Play Store that you approved via [Play For Work](./console/play-work/index.md).

* As seen in image below, the first step is for user to choose whether they want to provision their device in kiosk or multi app mode by clicking on the radio button.

1.  **Kiosk mode** - This mode pins the selected private app as the default app that stays pinned on the device screen permanently unless user exits the kiosk mode. This mode is useful for cases where device is single purpose and only app needs to run on it and admin does not wish device users to be able to interact with the device in any other manner. For example airport kiosks.

2.  **Multi-app mode** - In multi app mode, user is free to use any private app, google play app or preloaded (in-ROM) app which are approved and installed by the admin. It is closely similar to BYOD but admin retains the control of the apps that are usable by the device user. For example a grocery delivery company wants their delivery person using the device to be able to use company app as well as the google maps.

### Default Android Launcher <Badge text="New" type="tip"/>

The next section is a simple checkbox labeled "Default Android Launcher" - This feature, if checked will provision devices with default android screen with no restrictions on the apps that can be installed and used. It will also disable various Esper Agent features and is best used when device usage is desired in loosely controlled environment. <br>

  Here is a list of Esper features that will be **unavailable** in this mode as it applies the launcherless version of the Esper Device agent -

  • Capture Screenshot <br> • Remote View and Remote Control<br> • Install an app via dashboard<br> • Uninstall an app via dashboard<br> • Over the Air OS updates for Esper Enhanced Android OS<br> • Latest Device Agent updates for Devices with Android version less than 6.0

  ![Device Template](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/launcherlessdpc.png)

  The device screen will look similar to a regular android device with `Esper Device Agent` showing up as an app that can be opened and closed.

  ![Device Template](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/launcherlessdpc1.png)

  Even when user has exited the `Esper Device Agent` they will be able to see it running in the background in the notification bar as follows -

  ![Device Template](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/launcherlessdpc2.png)


If the `Default Android launcher` is **unchecked**, Esper Device agent will take admin control of the device and only approved apps can be installed or used. All features of Esper Device agents will be functional in this case.

* **Preloaded Apps** - The next section is of Preloaded (IN-ROM) apps where user may enter package names of apps that are already existing in the device to approve them to show up on the device after provisioning. The package names must be entered seperated by commas.

* **Private (uploaded) Apps** - The next section is for Private(uploaded) apps. User needs to upload APK files on App Management previously. Once uploaded, in template, user may click on the app from the dropdown, select the version and click on `Add` to add the private app to the template.

  ![Device Template](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/Temp_App_Management_new1.png)

* **To add app from Play Store list** - click on the apps to add from the list of available apps. This section is a little tricky because user needs to approve the Google apps from Play Store or Play for Work section before they are able to choose them in this section.

:::tip
Only once you [Approve a Google Play Store App](./console/device-template/how-approve-google-play-store-app/index.md), you may add it from the list shown in the Device Template.

Policy is a standard set of rules or permissions that are related to security of the devices and apps that admin can apply on the devices to be provisioned via template. Admin may set default app permissions, Android setting app, system updates, password rules, and turn on the toggle buttons for the settings he/she wishes to enable on the devices.

* A new policy is created and can be deployed on any device.
* The new policy gets listed on the **'Compliance Policy'** page which can be edited or deleted as required:

![Policy Management](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/3_PM.png)

Below is a list of features you can turn on or off in the policy section. These are part of our standard Compliance policy that can be configured and reapplied as per requirements of the customer after provisioning.

### Dropdown menus

1.  Device Password Rules - If you choose alphabetic or alphanumeric, a minimum passowrd length can be entered. The default minimum password length is 4. <br> The Password rule is a policy that specifies the rules for the device unlock password that users can set.

        Alphabetic: Restricts acceptable password to contain only alphabetic characters (A to Z) in both upper and lower case.

        Alphanumeric: Expands from Alphabetic to also include numbers and special characters.

        None: There is no password required to lock the device.

        The password for a device is setup during the initial setup of the device by the user.

    <br/>

2.  Default App Permission<br> Default app permissions determines enforcement of the runtime-permission rule across all the apps on a device (e.g. Gallery, Camera).


    Allow automatically: This rule will grant all the permissions any app requests without showing a prompt to the user.

    Ask user: This keeps the default behavior intact with regards to permission management. All apps on the device will show a prompt to the user to request permission. For example, by choosing this option then every app will ask the user each time before accessing a device module with a message such as “Allow app X to access Gallery? Allow/Deny”

    Deny automatically: This rule will deny any permission request from any app on the device.<br/>

3.  System Updates<br> The System updates option allows you to enforce a system update policy on the device when a system update/OTA update is available.

        Update automatically: Enforcing this rule will install any OTA update automatically and reboot the device without requesting the user.

        Postpone installation: This option postpones installation of an OTA update for 30 days.

        Windowed installation: This option allows you to define a time window during a full day period inside which the OTA update will be installed.

     <br/>

4.  Android Settings App<br> Android settings app determines how users can access the Android device settings.

        Default setting app: Selecting this will show the icon for the default Android settings app. Clicking this icon will take the user to the default Android settings.

        No settings app: No icon for any settings app will be available for the user to choose from the device’s dashboard.

        Esper settings app: Esper offers a custom Settings’ app that limits the user to only a subset of the available Android settings. Settings provided via this app are limited to:
        1. Changing the Wi-Fi AP

        2. Enabling the “flashlight” if there’s a camera flash LED on the device

        3. Control the display orientation of the device.

        Contact Esper to setup a password for the Esper Settings app.

## Geofence <Badge text="New" type="tip"/>

Now in Esper - Geofences! Geofencing is a useful feature for some dedicated device deployment scenarios. With geofencing you use the device’s location typically generated by GPS to trigger an alert when the device enters or leaves a defined area. Common scenarios include making sure a fleet of delivery devices stay in their delivery zone, warehousing devices don’t stray far from the warehouse, and restaurant ordering devices don’t leave the restaurant.

In order for geofencing to work, the mobile device needs Internet connectivity and location services enabled. Thus this is typically for cellular connected devices with high accuracy location services enabled - whether smartphones or tablets.

Setting up a geofence for a device is easy - it starts by selecting Geofence in Esper Console left navigation pane - this brings you up to a wizard for quickly defining the geofence. Click on `New Geofence`:

![](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/geo4.png)

In the first screen you define the size of your geofence (meaning where you expect any devices to be for this geofence) - it is a circle that can be as small as 100m radius up to 10km. Note that GPS can drift and jump, thus a geofence smaller than 100m can cause false positives. To set it up at a location simply type the address for the center of the circle, or drag it in the map view to set it up. Give it a name and description, and then click `Next`:

![](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/geo3.png)

Now you assign devices to this geofence - you can do as many as you need that fit the criteria for the geofence. In this case we are just doing one:

![](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/geo1.png)

Now you define the action to be taken when any of the assigned devices leave the geofence - you can either lock them, have them beep, or both. In this case I went with beep!

![](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/geo2.png)

If you chose to Lockdown the device, you will see the following screen if the device is taken outside the geofence boundary -

![](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/geo5.jpg)

You can see for Geofence applied Devices if they have left or entered the Geofence in the Event Feed section: ![](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/geo6.png)

That’s it! It looks even easier in our [video](https://youtu.be/UkTwhFRTwgQ) 
Give it a try and let us know what you think, andi@esper.io.

:::tip
Note: The performance of Geofencing feature is dependent on accuracy of in-built GPS of devices. Additionally, ability to track location of the device is also dependent on WiFi, Bluetooth, cellular connectivity and internet of the device.

## Developer Options

**Turn App and Device Management into Code**

Esper is focused on helping Android app developers build, deliver, and maintain Dedicated Device applications - whether a restaurant kiosk, retail POS, or logistics hub. We have made our APIs available to Android developers worldwide so they can move rote app and device management actions into reusable code. Anyone can use our APIs to build, orchestrate, and integrate elegant solutions based on their business requirements. We do the heavy lifting by taking care of the infrastructure, so app developers can focus on building great solutions rather than being bogged down in app and device management. We help you procure efficient hardware along with the optional secure, optimized Esper Enhanced Android and our open source APIs and SDKs. We also offer the Esper Plugin for the Android Studio with tools improving the challenging task of app diagnostics - including working with deployed apps running on dedicated devices in the field. Check out [esper.io](http://esper.io) for more information about our rich feature set.

To kick things off, you need to generate an **API key** that you can tie to a specific application - it is your choice on how you want to manage your API keys. Do this by clicking the **"Register App"** button. You can also easily copy the Enterprise ID, necessary for API calls, by clicking on the copy icon next to Enterprise ID on top right of this section.

![Developer Options](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/1_DO.png)

Next, you need to enter a unique app name and description(optional) and click **register application**.

![Developer Options](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/2_DO.png)

Click Generate Token. This will generate a unique **OAuth-based API key**.

![Developer Options](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/3_DO.png)

You can then copy (or renew if needed) your API key.

![Developer Options](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/4_DO.png)

The **API key** and **Enterprise ID** can be copied from the dashboard as shown above and can be used to access our [CLI platform](https://github.com/esper-io/esper-cli) (https://github.com/esper-io/esper-cli) as well as to use the [SDK/API](http://api.esper.io) (api.esper.io) in your development and management systems.

Checkout the relevant documentation on the top right of this page by clicking on [Developer Hub](https://docs.esper.io/) and [API Documentation](https://api.esper.io/).

## Secure Remote ADB

Developer should be able to debug their devices remotely without even physical association with the device. ADB is android tool that help you to get take actions on the device, get the device or application logs and help you in resolving customer or in-field issues right by sitting remotely in your office.

This document tells you how you can remotely connect to device via secure adb channel. We will be using esper-cli command line tool which internally uses [esperSDK](https://docs.esper.io/home/pythonsdk.html) [APIs](https://api.esper.io/) to provide the secure access between your host machine and device.

Remote access to the device can be done from anywhere in the world using espercli and doesn't have to be in the same network.

### Steps to connect to secure remote adb:

1.  On to Esper Dashboard https://{{ esper_tenant_name }}.esper.cloud, Go to `Devices` tab, then to your device and to `Actions`.

2.  At the bottom of the page, Click `enable adb`.

3.  On to your android device, connect via usb cable and enable adb over tcpip by following command:
    ```sh
    adb tcpip 5555
    ```
4.  Disconnect usb cable from the device. You should be able to connect adb via port 5555 over tcp

5.  Setup [esper-cli](https://docs.esper.io/home/espercli.html) and configure for your environment on to the host machine.
    - Check your espercli version: espercli -v
    ```sh
    #espercli -v
    Esper CLI is Command line tool for the Esper APIs:  0.0.5
    Cement Framework 3.0.2
    Python 3.7.3
    Platform Darwin-18.0.0-x86_64-i386-64bit
    ```
    - Make sure it is >= 0.0.5 to use secure-adb feature.
    - Upgrade to the latest version of espercli using the following command:
    ```sh
    pip install -U espercli
    ```
6.  Copy your device id from esper dashboard information tab or from your device bottom left most. It looks like SNA-SNL-1234.

7.  Use espercli to connect to Device:
    ```sh
    #espercli secureadb connect -d SNA-SNL-1234
     Initiating Remote ADB Session. This may take a few seconds...
     Secure ADB Client
     Please connect ADB client to the following endpoint: 127.0.0.1 : 62945
     If adb-tools is installed, please run the command below:
     adb connect 127.0.0.1:62945
    ```
8.  Now connect your device via port number obtained above on localhost.
    ```sh
    adb connect 127.0.0.1:62945
    ```
9.  You are connected to adb.

::: warning
Now onwards until device is rebooted, You would be able to connect to the device remotely using espercli. Post reboot you have to do Step 1-8 again
