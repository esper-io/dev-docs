## Manage Home

This page explains the functionality of the Esper Home Dashboard.

There are four tile sections on the Home Dashboard page:

### 1\. Deployment Status

This tile shows the current deployment status of the devices for the current customer environment and includes a clickable link to number of Active, Inactive, Under Provisioning and Recently Added devices. Clicking on each takes the user to the [Device Dashboard](./console.md#devices) showing the corresponding category of devices.

### 2\. Security Summary

The Security Summary tile shows a summary of security status of the deployed devices. It shows how many of them are at High Risk, Medium Risk, Low Risk and No Risk. Clicking on each takes the user to the [Device Dashboard](./console.md#devices) showing the corresponding category of devices.

### 3\. Where are your Devices?

This section gives an overview of the location where all the devices are deployed. You can see a world map showing locations of all the devices in Map and Satellite View. It can be made full screen and user has options to zoom in and zoom out. There is also a summary of cities worldwide containing the highest number of devices.

### 4\. Alerts Status

The Alerts Status tile gives a summary of Alerts you've created and Alerts that have been fired for each of the created Alerts. The Alert name can be selected from the dropdown and the number of Alerts fired will then be shown.

## Provision Device

Provisioning is the initial step to configuring and managing your Android device using the Esper Management Console and associated developer tools.

Esper provides multiple methods of provisioning a device, which involves downloading the Esper Agent onto the device and configuring it according to the provisioning settings used for a Device Template. The supported provisioning methods are as follows:


![Provisioning](./assets/provisioning/provisioning1.png)

You may provision your device using any of the four methods given the pre requisites mentioned are met. To see the detailed steps, hover your mouse over any of the provisioning methods and `Provision` button appears. On clicking the same, detailed steps for the selected method will start showing.

![Provisioning](./assets/provisioning/provisioning4.png)

If you find choosing between these methods confusing, for your convenience, we have provided an easy way to choose a provisioning method by filling the form on the right side. User needs to fill the following sections - 
- Android version - Check the android version on your device by going to Settings -> About ->  Android Version

   ![Provisioning](./assets/provisioning/provisioning2.png)
   
   Choose the android version of your device from the drop down menu. 
   
:::tip
Kitkat, Lollipop, Marshmallow etc are Google names for android versions 4.4, 5.0, 6.0 and so on.
:::

   ![Provisioning](./assets/provisioning/provisioning3.png)

- Esper Enhanced - Esper Enhanced Android is purpose-built optimized Android OS with enhanced performance, security and features such as zero touch provisioning, remote adb debugging and OTA android updates. Esper provides Esper Enhanced devices on request from customers. Choose `YES`, if your devices are Esper Enhanced.

- GMS support - Choose `YES`, if your android device supports Google Mobile Services. If Play Store app exists in your device, your device is a GMS device.

![Provisioning](./assets/provisioning/playstoreicon.png)

- Camera -  Choose `YES`, if your device has a working camera.

Finally, click on `Suggest Provisioning Method`. 

Based on your selection, you will be suggested with one out of the four provisioning methods which will get highlighted. Click on the same to see the steps to provision your device.

The four methods of provisioning have the below pre requisites. Click on each topic to know more.

1.  [AfW provisioning](./console/device-provisioning/afw-provisioning/index.md) - AfW (Android for Work) method is best used for:

    - Devices that have GMS (Google Mobile Services) support enabled
    - Devices with a camera for QR code scanning
    - Android 6.0 and above
    - Factory reset required

If you still have trouble figuring the provisioning process, Esper support will be happy to assist you. Please contact us on andi@esper.io or support@esper.io.


## Device Template

### How to use Esper's Device Template.

Device Template is a one stop means for you to quickly provision your device. It lets you create a profile for the device where you may choose the policy, apps, device settings, Device Group, and the wallpapers that you want to be provisioned on the device. Device Templates can be created, saved, and used to provision at a later point.

### Steps to create a Device Template.

1.  Click on 'Device Template'.
2.  Click on 'Create Template'.
3.  Enter a name for the Device Template. You also have an option to enter a description for the template. 

     Dashboard users and admins create templates in a context, for example creating a template to define the device behavior for a set of devices deployed in Burbank warehouse. The description box enables the context to be associated and saved with the Templates.


![Device Template](./assets/template/templatedesc1.png)

Click `Next`.

### In the Policy section

Policy is a standard set of rules or permissions that are related to security of the devices and apps that admin can apply on the devices to be provisioned via template. Admin may set default app permissions, Android setting app, system updates, password rules, and turn on the toggle buttons for the settings he/she wishes to enable on the devices.

Below is a list of features you can turn on or off in the policy section. These are part of our standard Compliance policy that can be configured and reapplied as per requirements of the customer after provisioning.

### Dropdown menus

1.  **Device Password Rules** \
    If you choose alphabetic or alphanumeric, a minimum password length can be entered. The default minimum password length is 4. The Password rule is a policy that specifies the rules for the device unlock password that users can set.

    - **Alphabetic**: Restricts acceptable password to contain only alphabetic characters (A to Z) in both upper and lower case.

    - **Alphanumeric**: Expands from Alphabetic to also include numbers and special characters.

    - **None**: There is no password required to lock the device.

    The password for a device is setup during the initial setup of the device by the user.

2.  **Default App Permission** \
    Default app permissions determines enforcement of the runtime-permission rule across all the apps on a device (e.g. Gallery, Camera).

    - **Allow automatically**: This rule will grant all the permissions any app requests without showing a prompt to the user.

    - **Ask user**: This keeps the default behavior intact with regards to permission management. All apps on the device will show a prompt to the user to request permission. For example, by choosing this option then every app will ask the user each time before accessing a device module with a message such as “Allow app X to access Gallery? Allow/Deny”

    - **Deny automatically**: This rule will deny any permission request from any app on the device.<br/>

3.  **System Updates** \
    The System updates option allows you to enforce a system update policy on the device when a system update/OTA update is available.

    - **Update automatically**: Enforcing this rule will install any OTA update automatically and reboot the device without requesting the user.

    - **Postpone installation**: This option postpones installation of an OTA update for 30 days.

    - **Windowed installation**: This option allows you to define a time window during a full day period inside which the OTA update will be installed.

     <br/>

4.  **Android Settings App** \
    Android settings app determines how users can access the Android device settings.

    - **Default setting app**: Selecting this will show the icon for the default Android settings app. Clicking this icon will take the user to the default Android settings.

    - **No settings app**: No icon for any settings app will be available for the user to choose from the device’s dashboard.

    - **Esper settings app**: 

       Esper offers a custom Settings’ app that limits the user to only a subset of the available Android settings. This app is made secure via the Esper settings app password protection. Settings provided via this app are limited to:
        1. Changing the Wi-Fi Access Point

        2. Enabling the “flashlight” if there’s a camera flash LED on the device

        3. Control the display orientation of the device.

        4. A robust means for users to be able to factory reset their device irrespective of the policy. 
        
        5. About - We have added information regarding provisioning endpoint in the about section for the user to be able to view the endpoint name the device is registered in, in case they have access to multiple endpoints.
        
        6. Kiosk app - An option to switch the kiosk app from this menu. User can choose any installed app on device to act as the kiosk app.
        
        7. Esper Branding - User can turn off the Esper logo in case they wish to use their own logo as a reseller of Esper platform.
    

    ![](./assets/esperSettingsApp/espersettingapp1.png)

5. **Dock & Empty Settings App Password** <br> 
    In Kiosk mode, Device user can access a hidden dock consisting of menu items such as Esper settings app by tapping 3 times on top right corner or by clicking the power button 3 times. This text field is to protect accessibility for this feature via password.  The dock menu consists of multi-app mode - kiosk mode switch, Esper settings app and Power button. 

    ![](./assets/esperSettingsApp/espersettingapp2.png)

    The textbox here accepts the common password for Dock and the Esper Settings App. It is now acceptable to not have any password for these features for the ease of device users. Esper, however, recommends that passwords are setup for stronger security.
    <br/>


### Google Account Restrictions


 This feature gives users an option to restrict the number of Google accounts that can be added on the device and be used with Google apps such as Gmail, Google Play Store, Youtube etc. By default, the addition of any number of accounts is allowed, however, if the admin applies a Compliance policy by checking the box shown below, the number of allowed accounts will be restricted to the admin entered value. For example, if the admin has set it to 2, after adding two accounts on the device, further addition (or deletion) of accounts will not be possible unless a different Compliance policy is reapplied.
Note: If user has not checked this box in the applied policy, it is recommended that they disable Google Play Store to prevent installation of unapproved apps.


![Google Account Restrictions](./assets/GoogleAccountid/googleaccountpermission1.png)

:::tip
The Google Account Restriction feature is applicable only to GMS android devices ie the android devices that support Google Mobile Services.
:::


### Factory Reset Protection 

FRP or Factory Reset Protection enables you to lock your device if a user tries to factory reset it via soft/hard keys. In case of a factory reset, the device will get locked and will only be reusable by a pre-authorized google account ID. See Policy section in docs to know how to get your google account id. Note that this feature is only available on android versions 5 and above. <br>

![Factory Reset Protection](./assets/GoogleAccountid/factory_reset_protection.png)

On turning on the FRP button, user needs to enter the Google ID of the account they wish to authorize to enable usage of the device post factory reset. <br/>

See [here](./console/policy-management/getgoogleaccount.md) to know how to get the Google account ID of your account and how FRP protects your device.

Other Template Compliance Policy Toggle Buttons-<br>

15. **USB File transfer** <br> Turning off USB file transfer will prevent the user from transferring files from the device to a computer and vice versa using a USB cable<br/>
16. **Google Assistant** <br> Enables/disables voice command via Google Assistant. Available only for Android devices supporting Google Assistant. For example - If you wish to have Google Play Store show up on the device, you may turn on the toggle button. <br> 
17. **Local App Install**<br>This feature allows installation of apps from unknown sources on the device. To enable this on the device, the user needs to follow these instructions. Settings->Apps and notifications-> Special app permissions ->Install Unknown Apps and choose the route they wish to install the apps from. For example, if device user chooses Chrome, they will be able to download and install apps from the Chrome browser on the device. If turned Off, the device user will not be allowed to install apps from any unknown sources.<br>

![LocalAppInstall](./assets/policy/localappinstall.png)
 <br/>

### Restrict outgoing/incoming calls using customised dialer.

![Restrictcall](./assets/policy/restrictcall.png)

If clicked, this opens up two more checkboxes-<br>

1.  `Restrict incoming calls to uploaded contacts only <upload a CSV file of allowed contacts>`<br>
2.  `Restrict outgoing calls to uploaded contacts only <upload a CSV file of allowed contacts>`<br> In order to restrict phone numbers that can make or receive calls to the device, upload a .csv file with the allowed phone numbers.<br>

:::tip
All numbers must be preceded by +country code (for example +1 for US). All numbers must be separated by comma.
:::

<br> <br/>
Compliance Policy Section of the Device Template - 
![Device Template](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/newpolicytemplate.png) <br> <br/> You may reset these values to default at any time by clicking `Reset to Default` button at the bottom. <br> <br/> Click `Next`. <br> <br/>

### In the Apps section

In this section, you can select 'Kiosk mode' to pin an app during startup or 'Multi application mode' to give device-users access to the Home screen. You can choose the apps that you would like to have installed on your device during provisioning. You may choose from install apps you uploaded via [App Management](./console.md#apps) or install apps from Google Play Store that you approved via [Play For Work](./console/play-work/index.md).


As seen in image below, the first step is for user to choose whether they want to provision their device in kiosk or multi app mode by clicking on the radio button.


![Device Template](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/devicemode.png)

1.  **Kiosk mode** - This mode pins the selected private app as the default app that stays pinned on the device screen permanently unless user exits the kiosk mode. This mode is useful for cases where device is single purpose and only app needs to run on it and admin does not wish device users to be able to interact with the device in any other manner. For example airport kiosks.

2.  **Multi-app mode** - In multi app mode, user is free to use any private app, google play app or preloaded (in-ROM) app which are approved and installed by the admin. It is closely similar to BYOD but admin retains the control of the apps that are usable by the device user. For example a grocery delivery company wants their delivery person using the device to be able to use company app as well as the google maps.

### Default Android Launcher 

The next section is a simple checkbox labeled "Default Android Launcher" - 
This feature gives user an option to choose Esper Agent to run in the background as an app instead of being permanently pinned on the screen. 

![Device Template](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/launcherlessdpc.png)

When this box is **checked**, the default android launcher will be active and user can exit Esper Agent (DPC) like any other android app. Esper Agent (DPC) will continue to run in the background and execute device management functionality. Many of Esper features will not be applicable if this version of Esper Agent (DPC) is installed.

If the Default Android launcher is **unchecked**, Esper Device agent will take admin control of the device and only approved apps can be installed or used. All features of Esper Device agents will be functional in this case. This use case gives more control to the Dashboard admin on the apps that a device user may use and actions that can be taken on the device. 
<br>

Here is a list of Esper features that will be **unavailable in the default android launcher (also known as launcherless mode)**  as it applies the launcherless version of the Esper Device agent -

• Capture Screenshot <br> • Remote View and Remote Control<br>  • Over the Air OS updates for Esper Enhanced Android OS<br> • Latest Device Agent updates for Devices with Android version less than 6.0



The device screen will look similar to a regular android device with `Esper Device Agent` showing up as an app that can be opened and closed.

![Device Template](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/launcherlessdpc1.png)

Even when user has exited the `Esper Device Agent` they will be able to see it running in the background in the notification bar as follows -

![Device Template](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/launcherlessdpc2.png)



- **Preloaded Apps** - The next section is of Preloaded (IN-ROM) apps where user may enter package names of apps that are already existing in the device to approve them to show up on the device after provisioning. The package names must be entered separated by commas.

  ![Device Template](./assets/template-app/preloadedapps.png)

- **Private (uploaded) Apps** - The next section is for Private(uploaded) apps. User needs to upload APK files on App Management previously. Once uploaded, in template, user may click on the app from the dropdown, select the version and click on `Add` to add the private app to the template.

   ![Device Template](./assets/template-app/privateapps.png)

- **To add app from Play Store list** - click on the apps to add from the list of available apps. This section is a little tricky because user needs to approve the Google apps from Play Store or Play for Work section before they are able to choose them in this section.


   ![Device Template](./assets/template-app/playstoreapps.png)


For convenience, a PlayStore tab has been provided on this page where users can approve Google apps that need to be added to template.


   ![Device Template](./assets/template-app/playstoreicon.png)


:::tip
Only once you [Approve a Google Play Store App](./console/device-template/how-approve-google-play-store-app/index.md), you may add it from the list shown in the Device Template.
:::

Click `Next`.

### In the Branding section

Upload landscape and/or portrait wallpaper.

![Device Template](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/11_DT.png)

There is an option to Preview the uploaded wallpapers:

![Device Template](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/11.1_DT.png)

Click `Next`.

### In the Settings section

Change Device settings from Esper Dashboard. Following are features available <br> 

- Turn on/off bluetooth <br>
- Select screen timeout duration <br> - Dashboard user can decide the time after which the device screen should get locked. Similar to stock android devices, we have options such as 5s, 15s, 30s, 1 minute and so on. There is also an option of the device screen 'Never' timing out such as in use case of a digital signage device. We have following screen lock timeouts - 

    5 seconds<br>
    15 seconds<br>
    30 seconds<br>
    1 minute<br>
    2 minutes<br>
    5 minutes<br>
    10 minutes<br>
    30 minutes<br>
    Never<br>


![Esper Timezone](./assets/template/screentimeoutdevice.png)


- Select screen orientation <br>
- Select GPS accuracy <br>
- Increase/decrease Brightness, Volume (alarm, notification, ring and music) <br>
- Timezone  - With our supervisor plugin, we have enabled you to change timezone of device remotely via dashboard.

![Esper Timezone](./assets/settings/timezone.png)

We have introduced a robust search capability such that even as the dashboard user begins to type, the suggestions show up conveniently for the dashboard to select and set the timezone. For example, typing 'Pacific' will bring up all timezones starting with 'Pacific' prefix.

![Esper Timezone](./assets/settings/timezone2.png)

- ADB - This option gives user capability to enable ADB on the device using the template for 30 minutes post provisioning.  This is useful in cases where the admin or support engineer is provisioning the device for the first time and wants to make sure that we still have access to communicate with device in case of any issues. It is also useful for testing the device with tools that require communication via adb. For security purposes we have limited the time for which adb stays on.

![Device Template](./assets/template/template-adb.png)

- Wifi SSID -  In order to make the 6-tap provisioning process easier, we are introducing the capability to include the required WiFi credentials in the QR code generated via a Device Template. After reading the QR code, the device automatically connects to the WiFi access point using the SSID and password entered for the template. 
The bottom section of Template-Settings page is where you can see the heading “Ability to add Wifi credentials to the QR code” -

![Device Template](./assets/template/wifissid1.png)


Basically three fields: WiFi SSID, WiFi Password and WiFi Security type. Out of these three, 



User may enter WiFi SSID, password and choose the security type in the dropdown shown below. The WiFi security type can take only four values: NONE, WPA, WEP or EAP.

![Device Template](./assets/template/wifissid2.png)

An extra drop down appears when option EAP is selected for further security settings. 

In more technical terms, here, provisioning Wifi phase 2 authorization (android.app.extra.PROVISIONING_WIFI_PHASE2_AUTH) must be defined which accepts: NONE, PAP, MSCHAP, MSCHAPV2, GTC, SIM, AKA or AKA_PRIME. 

Read more about these options [here](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiEnterpriseConfig.Eap).


![Device Template](./assets/template/wifissid3.png)


Upon reading the QR code, the device will automatically connect to the WiFi access point if it is available. 


Here is a complete view of Settings section in Template -

If you are logging in to your endpoint for the very first time you will see the following screen which gives you a choice to either provision a device or Simulate a device.

![Simulare](./console/images/simulare-1.png)

You can choose to provision a real Android device the details to which are provided in the [Provision Device](./console/device-provisioning/index.md) section of this documentation. Or you may choose to Simulate a Device. You will see a momentary "You are all set!" message after which a mock device will be available for you to experiment and play around with till you provision an actual device.

![Simulare](./console/images/simulare-2.png)

Simulare helps you explore the Esper platform without using a real device. We provide this simulated device to act as an actual device to help you experience the capabilities of our platform.

Capabilities such as Apps, Remote View and Capture log might not be available on a Simulated device.

This device is only available for new signups currently. Please note that trial accounts created on or after September 27, 2019 will have this feature enabled. Accounts created before that will not. Please reach out to us at support@esper.io if you signed up before September 27, and would like to try out Simulated devices.

### Categories

There are checkboxes on the top of the page with categories such as  that can be checked to view devices in each particular state-
 - Active - currently online  
 - Inactive - currently offline
 - Under provisioning - devices undergoing provisioning 
 - Devices with low battery - devices with battery under 30% charging
 - Recently added devices - devices provisioned within the last 3 days
 - Low risk devices - device with security status low
 - Medium risk devices - devices with security status medium
 - High risk devices - devices with security status high
 - No risk devices - device with security status 'secure'

 See the [Security](https://docs.esper.io/home/console/device-management/-/#security) section to know how the security status of a device is determined

### Search

Search is provided on the top right where you can search for devices in Devices using the Esper assigned device code which is displayed on the device homepage.

### Device View

There are 3 types of viewing styles - grid, list and maps. The default view is Grid, but the user can click on list and maps to access the list view and the map view. 

Under the Grid view each device will be represented as tiles in the ‘Device management’ tab with a summary of all device information such as location, network, health, and risk status of the device. Click on [](./console/device-management/-/index.md) on the tile for any individual device to see further actions and changes that can be made for this device:

### Grid View 

Under the Grid view each device will be represented as tiles in the ‘Device management’ tab with a summary of all device information such as location, network, health, and risk status of the device. Click on [Details](./console/device-management/-/index.md) on the tile for any individual device to see further actions and changes that can be made for this device:

![Device Management](./assets/devicetab/gridview1.png)

#### Device Tiles

Devices which have been enrolled on to your Esper Cloud are provisioned devices:

Example 1- 
This is a device at high security risk highlighted in red. Its currently offline and supports Google Mobile services.
It is connected to wifi Esper-SSID. It was last seen on 12/10/2019 at Bellevue, Washington.

![Device Management](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/devicetile1.png)

Example 2- 
This is a device is secure hence highlighted in green. Its currently offline and supports Google Mobile services.
It is connected to wifi JZSB. It was last seen on 12/06/2019 at Kuala Lumpur.

![Device Management](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/devicetile2.png)

Example 3- 
This is a device at low risk hence highlighted in dark grey. Its currently offline and supports Google Mobile services.
It is connected to wifi Droidcon. It was last seen on 09/20/2019 at an undetermined location. It has been tagged with DroidConNYC indicating it was used to demo in Droid conference held in NYC. This is an example of how customers can use tags to identify and search their devices.

![Device Management](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/devicetile3.png)

Example 4 - Devices listed 'Under Provisioning' refer to devices which are still getting provisioned (such as google app getting updated etc). These are devices that have not yet achieved the active status. 

![Device Management](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/Under_Provisioning.png)

### List View
 When the number of devices in a fleet crosses over into the 100s it is hard to view or sort them in the device tile view. With the new List View users can easily see a list of all devices available on the dashboard along with device information columns including online/offline status, serial number, group name, Android version, and andy tags. 

Search by device name can be used without having to click and enter into device details page to get detailed information about each device. 


![Device Management](./assets/devicetab/listview1.png)

Each device name is a link that will take the dashboard user to the [details](./console/device-management/-/index.md) of that device.

This view gives the capability to filter devices via - 

1. Group Name - Gives the option to choose any one group
2. Policy Name - Gives the option to choose any one policy
3. GMS/Non GMS - Gives option to choose between GMS and Non-GMS
4. Active/Inactive - Gives option to choose Active or Inactive device
5. Security Status - Gives option to choose between High Risk, Low Risk, Medium Risk and No Risk (or Secure) devices.

In the filters, a search capability has been provided to select values.
Currently, user can only filter by one value of each of above. For example, I can choose Group A, Policy B and Active which will give me a filtered list of devices in Group A which are active and have policy B applied on them.

![Device Management](./assets/devicetab/listview2.png)


### Map View

Under the Map view, the types of devices can be chosen from the dropdown. Once selected, the device locations are show:.

![Device Management](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/1.1_DM.png)

Once you click on the cluster icon, devices in the cluster will appear. Upon clicking on the individual devices, device information will be displayed. Clicking on the device name will take the dashboard user to [details](./console/device-management/-/index.md) section of that device.

## Groups

Using Groups devices can be sectioned into groups and mass actions can be performed on a group of devices. Users can perform mass reboot, lock, check heartbeat, apply a compliance policy, install/uninstall apps and OS updates on thousands of devices in one click using Group features. 

There is a pre-existing group called "All Devices", which is the default group where devices fall unless otherwise specified during provisioning via template.

### Creating a Group
You can create a Group by clicking the button `Create Group` on the top right. 

![Group Management](./assets/groups/creategroup2.png)

Enter a unique name and click Create. 

![Group Management](./assets/groups/creategroup1.png)

Once you create a Group, you have the option to add devices from the  default **All devices** group. To move devices, users can -
- click on the checkboxes on the left of the device that needs to be moved.  
- select all devices by clicking on the top checkbox.

## Compliance Policy

Policy is a standard set of rules or permissions that are related to security of the devices and apps that admin can apply on the devices to be provisioned via template. Admin may set default app permissions, Android setting app, system updates, password rules, and turn on the toggle buttons for the settings he/she wishes to enable on the devices.

- A new policy is created and can be deployed on any device.
- The new policy gets listed on the **'Compliance Policy'** page which can be edited or deleted as required:

![Policy Management](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/3_PM.png)


### Create a policy

Click on `New Policy` to start creating a new policy.

![Policy Management](./assets/policy/createpolicy1.png)

Dashboard users and admins create policies in a context, for example a compliance policy for any device operating at retail outlets in Texas. The description box enables the context to be associated and saved with Compliance Policies.

![Policy Management](./assets/policy/createpolicy2.png)

Below is a list of features you can turn on or off in the policy section. These are part of our standard Compliance policy that can be configured and reapplied as per requirements of the customer after provisioning.

### Available policy options

1.  Device Password Rules - If you choose alphabetic or alphanumeric, a minimum password length can be entered. The default minimum password length is 4. <br> The Password rule is a policy that specifies the rules for the device unlock password that users can set.

    Alphabetic: Restricts acceptable password to contain only alphabetic characters (A to Z) in both upper and lower case.

    Alphanumeric: Expands from Alphabetic to also include numbers and special characters.

    None: There is no password required to lock the device.

    The password for a device is setup during the initial setup of the device by the user.

    <br/>

2.  Default App Permission<br> 

    Default app permissions determines enforcement of the runtime-permission rule across all the apps on a device (e.g. Gallery, Camera).


    Allow automatically: This rule will grant all the permissions any app requests without showing a prompt to the user.

    Ask user: This keeps the default behavior intact with regards to permission management. All apps on the device will show a prompt to the user to request permission. For example, by choosing this option then every app will ask the user each time before accessing a device module with a message such as “Allow app X to access Gallery? Allow/Deny”

    Deny automatically: This rule will deny any permission request from any app on the device.<br/>

3.  System Updates<br> The System updates option allows you to enforce a system update policy on the device when a system update/OTA update is available.

    Update automatically: Enforcing this rule will install any OTA update automatically and reboot the device without requesting the user.

    Postpone installation: This option postpones installation of an OTA update for 30 days.

    Windowed installation: This option allows you to define a time window during a full day period inside which the OTA update will be installed.

     <br/>

4.  Android Settings App<br> Android settings app determines how users can access the Android device settings. There are three options to choose for the type of settings app to be made available on the device as follows - 

    _Default setting app_: Selecting this will show the icon for the default Android settings app. Clicking this icon will take the user to the default Android settings.

    _No settings app_: No icon for any settings app will be available for the user to choose from the device’s dashboard.

## Geofence

Now in Esper - Geofences! Geofencing is a useful feature for some dedicated device deployment scenarios. With geofencing you use the device’s location typically generated by GPS to trigger an alert when the device enters or leaves a defined area. Common scenarios include making sure a fleet of delivery devices stay in their delivery zone, warehousing devices don’t stray far from the warehouse, and restaurant ordering devices don’t leave the restaurant.

In order for geofencing to work, the mobile device needs internet connectivity and location services enabled. Thus this is typically for cellular connected devices with high accuracy location services enabled - whether smartphones or tablets.

Setting up a geofence for a device is easy - it starts by selecting Geofence in Esper Console left navigation pane - this brings you up to a wizard for quickly defining the geofence. Click on `New Geofence`:

![Esper Geofence Creation](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/geo4.png)

In the first screen you define the size of your geofence (meaning where you expect any devices to be for this geofence) - it is a circle that can be as small as 100m radius up to 10km. Note that GPS can drift and jump, thus a geofence smaller than 100m can cause false positives. To set it up at a location simply type the address for the center of the circle, or drag it in the map view to set it up. Give it a name and description, and then click `Next`:

![Esper Name Geofence](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/geo3.png)

Now you assign devices to this geofence - you can do as many as you need that fit the criteria for the geofence. In this case we are just doing one:

![Esper Assign devices](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/geo1.png)

Now you define the action to be taken when any of the assigned devices leave the geofence - you can either lock them, have them beep, or both. In this case I went with beep!

![Esper Select Actions Geofence](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/geo2.png)

If you chose to Lockdown the device, you will see the following screen if the device is taken outside the geofence boundary -

![Esper Lockdown](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/geo5.jpg)

You can see for Geofence applied Devices if they have left or entered the Geofence in the Event Feed section: ![Geofence in Event Feed](./assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/geo6.png)

That’s it! It looks even easier in our [video](https://youtu.be/UkTwhFRTwgQ) Give it a try and let us know what you think, andi@esper.io.

:::tip
Note: The performance of Geofencing feature is dependent on accuracy of in-built GPS of devices. Additionally, ability to track location of the device is also dependent on WiFi, Bluetooth, cellular connectivity and internet of the device. This feature is not supported for Android version 4.x.

## Pipeline

Introduction:

Esper Pipeline feature enables users to ensure smooth deployment of actions (including app installation) on large fleets of remote devices by defining stages constituting of operations, installations, tests, and wait time that are executed when a defined trigger occurs, such as when a new version of the app is uploaded. Only after succeeding in the above stages on test devices will the action get applied on production devices, hence ensuring a smooth deployment via a pipeline of stages. The initial version of the Esper Pipeline supports only the app installation operation and requires a 5 second or more break between the deletion of stages. 

![](./assets/pipeline/image2.png)

Pipeline has the capability to create n number of stages or operations for automating tasks. Different sets of tasks can be automated by creating pipelines & reduce the manual work to do it one by one.

V1 design, will do some limited operations & limited pipeline capabilities.  
 
Example use case: 
Let us consider a use case where enterprise wants to deploy app Ant v1.145 to their device fleet of 1000 devices deployed in Texas. It is very important to them that the deployment of the latest version of app Ant is smooth and without any errors. So they use pipelines to test this Ant v1.145 on various devices in different stages, they also ensure that it continues to run for a few hours on each set of devices and so on. Pipeline feature helps them easily plan the stages of tests and various operations that this app version has to succeed through before it is approved to be deployed on the fleet of production devices in Texas.

Steps Of Pipeline: 

Create A Pipeline

Pipeline info : Name a pipeline & give description if any.

![](./assets/pipeline/image11.png)

Trigger: Define a trigger which is an operation that sets off the pipeline in motion. Any time the defined trigger occurs, either via dashboard or via an api call or cli command, the pipeline will automatically start running. For V1 we currently only support the trigger where a new app version is uploaded. 


![](./assets/pipeline/image9.png)

 Stages: Post trigger, you need to define stages of the pipeline. For each stage, a name & description is given first, then you have to add operations that are to take place. For each operation, define name & description, operation type and finally, select a group of devices on which the operation will occur. For now operation is Install app or uninstall app. Users can create any number of stages as per their use case.

 ![](./assets/pipeline/image6.png)

 ![](./assets/pipeline/image10.png)
 

Preview & Save : Once user is done with above three steps they see the final preview & saves the pipeline & the pipeline will be created.

![](./assets/pipeline/image2.png)

Pipeline can be edited later at any moment as per the use case or we can add or remove stages .

 
## Company Settings

Learn about Esper's Company Settings.

- Company Settings enables you to set your company details by clicking on the **Edit profile** button on the top right hand corner:

## Secure Remote ADB

Developer should be able to debug their devices remotely without even physical association with the device. ADB is android tool that help you to get take actions on the device, get the device or application logs and help you in resolving customer or in-field issues right by sitting remotely in your office.

This document tells you how you can remotely connect to device via secure adb channel. We will be using esper-cli command line tool which internally uses [esperSDK](./pythonsdk.md) [APIs](https://api.esper.io/) to provide the secure access between your host machine and device.

Remote access to the device can be done from anywhere in the world using espercli and doesn't have to be in the same network.

### Steps to connect to secure remote adb:

1.  On to Esper Dashboard `https://{{ esper_tenant_name }}.esper.cloud`, Go to `Devices` tab, then to your device and to `Actions`.

2.  At the bottom of the page, Click `enable adb`.

3.  On to your android device, connect via usb cable and enable adb over tcpip by following command:

        adb tcpip 5555

4.  Disconnect usb cable from the device. You should be able to connect adb via port 5555 over tcp

5.  Setup [esper-cli](./espercli.md) and configure for your environment on to the host machine.

    - Check your espercli version: espercli -v

            #espercli -v
            Esper CLI is Command line tool for the Esper APIs:  0.0.5
            Cement Framework 3.0.2
            Python 3.7.3
            Platform Darwin-18.0.0-x86_64-i386-64bit

    - Make sure it is >= 0.0.5 to use secure-adb feature.
    - Upgrade to the latest version of espercli using the following command:

            pip install -U espercli

6.  Copy your device id from esper dashboard information tab or from your device bottom left most. It looks like SNA-SNL-1234.

7.  Use espercli to connect to Device:

        #espercli secureadb connect -d SNA-SNL-1234
        Initiating Remote ADB Session. This may take a few seconds...
        Secure ADB Client
        Please connect ADB client to the following endpoint: 127.0.0.1 : 62945
        If adb-tools is installed, please run the command below:
        adb connect 127.0.0.1:62945

8.  Now connect your device via port number obtained above on localhost.

        adb connect 127.0.0.1:62945

9.  You are connected to adb.

:::warning
Now onwards until device is rebooted, You would be able to connect to the device remotely using espercli. Post reboot you have to do Step 1-8 again
:::
