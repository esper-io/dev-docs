How to remotely view your device

*   Remote viewer is a feature which allows one to observe the device remotely. Whatever happens in the device can be monitored live.
*   The ‘Capture screenshot’ icon will capture the current screen of the device and can be viewed below along with other screenshots taken earlier.

*   For remote viewing of the device we need to click on the ‘Start session’ icon. This will establish a secure connection with the device and can be viewed in the screen on the side.
