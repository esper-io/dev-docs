## Device Actions

The second section consists of the `Actions` that can be performed on the device from cloud portal.


All the device actions that can be performed on active devices are listed below.

### Reboot

Click on the ‘Reboot’ option and then confirm to reboot the device remotely. This action is avaialable for devices with Android version 6.0 and above.

### Screen Lock

To lock the device screen , click on ‘Lock device’ and confirm the same. In this case, Device user will need to enter device password (if it has been set) inorder to use device again. 

### Heart beat

If the device has been inactive for a while, it means the device has entered Doze mode during which network activity is disabled.

The Ping device command forces the device to come out of Doze mode and tell the Dashboard it is active.

### Wipe device

In order to wipe or factory reset the device, click on ‘Wipe device’ tile. Toggle the external storage to ON if you want to wipe the external storage also.

Confirm by clicking ‘Wipe’ and the device will be automatically Wiped.

### Device Mode

If your device was provisioned in kiosk mode, you may use this button to exit out of the kiosk mode or enter back in. When you exit the kiosk mode, the kiosk mode app (selected during provisioning) will get unpinned and device user will be able to use the device in multi-application mode. When you click this button again, it will re-enter kiosk mode and the same app will again get pinned to the device screen.


### Device Lockdown <Badge text="New" type="tip"/>

This feature is introduced to completely lockdown the device in case of unauthorized usage or relocation etc. For example if a user takes device outside of the authorized area, or a company decides to prohibit user from using the device, they can do a complete lockdown. In this case, a custom message can be entered which will show on screen, for example a contact number to call or email.

When you click `Lockdown`, a custom message text box appears where user can enter the text they want the device user to see.

## Event Feed

This section shows the logs of event feedback received from the active devices. In the future, it will be used to read any anomaly in data behaviour to predict security issues.

## Device Graphs

This section represents the graphical representation of the various attributes of a particular device whose ID is displayed at the top. The values that can be monitored includes information related to battery, memory, WiFi, and their usage over time.

![Device Management](../../../assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/7_DM.png)

However, if a device stays inactive for more than 7 days, you will see an empty state requesting to activate the device: ![Device Management](../../../assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/8_DM.png)

## Compliance Policy

If user wants to switch to a new policy, they can select from the drop down menu and apply it. To create a new policy, click [here](../../../../home/console/device-management/-/#compliance-policy).

## Security

This page will inform user of security risks that device is facing. If there are any risks, it will show the threat level, cause of the threat, and advise user to secure the device.

![Device Management](../../../assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/Device_Security_image_1.png)

The security risk calculation and advise is done on basis of whether the devices that show signs of tampering or having been rooted. A device that has been tampered with for example, will be considered High Risk. An emulator or virtual device will also fall in High Risk category. 

Following are the criterion and details based on which the security risks are calculated - 

1. **BasicIntegrity** - BasicIntegrity gives you a signal about the general integrity of the device and its API. Rooted devices fail basicIntegrity, as do emulators, virtual devices, and devices with signs of tampering, such as API hooks.

2. **CtsProfileMatch** - CtsProfileMatch gives you a much stricter signal about the compatibility of the device. Only unmodified devices that have been certified by Google can pass ctsProfileMatch. Devices that will fail ctsProfileMatch include the following:

    a. Devices that fail basicIntegrity

    b. Devices with an unlocked bootloader.

    c. Devices with a custom system image (custom ROM)
    
    d. Devices for which the manufactured didn't apply for, or pass, Google certification

    e. Devices with a system image built directly from the Android Open Source Program source files

    f. Devices with a system image distributed as part of a beta or developer preview program (including the Android Beta Program)

    When present, the advice parameter provides information to help explain why the SafetyNet Attestation API set either ctsProfileMatch or basicIntegrity to false in a particular result. The parameter's value contains a list of strings, such as the        ones in the following example:

        {"advice": "LOCK_BOOTLOADER,RESTORE_TO_FACTORY_ROM"}

3. Security Patch Version - Last updated security patch version 

Device:
Device will send the above 3 fields in DeviceStatus and Device API. BasicIntegrity and CtsProfileMatch will be calculated on 3 instances:

1. During provisioning
2. When Requested from Dashboard
3. After every 5 hrs.


### Dashboard

Cloud will receive the above values and figure out the the security state, reason and advise.

* If Basic Integrity is false, then its a high risk device(<=5 points)
* If Basic Integrity is true, little more weightage to ctsProfile(3) then Security patch(2) out of 5 points. if both are false (= 5 points), consider medium risk.
* If Basic Integrity is true, Ctsprofile is also true and patch version is > 3 months old, then consider as a low risk.

### Points Table:

* 0-5 points   → High Risk
* 5-7 points   → Medium Risk
* 8-9 points   → Low Risk
* 9-10 points → Secure

## Remote Viewer

The remote viewer section lets the user remotely view the device and take screenshots of a remote device.


How to remotely view your device

*   Remote viewer is a feature which allows one to observe the device remotely and allow Admin (Dashboard user) to monitor the device live.

*   The ‘Capture screenshot’ button will capture the current screen of the device. There is a recorded history of all screenshots captured per device under the screenshots section.

*   For remote viewing of the device we need to click on the ‘Start session’ icon. Once the user allows the remote view request, a secure connection will get established and device screen will be streamed on the dashboard. 

![Device Management](../../../assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/4_DM.png)

*   The session automatically ends after 15 minutes. You can also stop it by clicking the ‘Stop session’.

![Device Management](../../../assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/5_DM.png)

*   The ‘Portrait’ button allows you to turn the screen to portrait as well as landscape mode.
*   Single Device to Cloud session is allowed at a time.

### Remote Control

On Esper Enhanced Devices, or devices that have manufacture signed supervisor plugin in the system, there is an option to `Remote Control` the device. This means that any action such as click performed on the dashboard will result in remote action on the device. 

### Capture Logs

This section lets the user capture bug report from the device in question. You can select the bug report radio button and press the 'Start' button. The status will change from `Requesting Report` to `Permission Granted` to `Download`. The last status 'Download' is a link that will download the bug report with date and time stamp from the device to help your technical staff debug any issues. If device user denies the permission to share the logs, the status will change to `Permission Denied by User`.

![Device Management](../../../assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/10_DM.png)

:::tip
Please note that the user on the device side needs to swipe down the notification bar and click on the bug report line. On being prompted, the device user needs to choose `Share`. If they choose `Decline` the Bug Report will not be shared.
