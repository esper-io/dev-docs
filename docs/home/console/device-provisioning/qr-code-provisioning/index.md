# QR Code Provisioning

This page describes how user can provision their devices using the **QR Code** Method.

Similar to the AfW method, the device needs to be prepared for provisioning by bringing up the QR code scanner.

A QR code is generated in the Esper Console using a [Device Template](../../device-template/index.md). It is scanned using the device to complete the provisioning.

Follow the below two steps to provision a device:

1.  [On the Esper Console](./steps-take-cloud-portal-6tap/index.md)

2.  [On the Device](device-side-6-tap-method/index.md)

[Return to Provision Device](../index.md)
