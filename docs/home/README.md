# Introduction

Esper is at heart a technology company that provides Android dedicated device fleet management solutions for enterprises led by APIs, SDKs, and tools for developers. Based in Silicon Valley with supporting teams in Seattle, Esper is currently the only company providing a full stack, API-driven implementation delivering a secure platform for purpose-built Android-based dedicated devices.

## Overview

Welcome to the Esper Console where Android™ developers can build, test, deploy, diagnose, and manage their applications seamlessly and securely to Android-based dedicated devices. Using the console, you will be able to generate API Keys and obtain your Enterprise ID; this enables you to use the Esper [APIs](./api.md) either by calling them via [REST](https://api.esper.io/), with our Esper [SDK for Python](./pythonsdk.md), or by using our Esper [CLI](./espercli.md). Additionally, our Esper [plugin](./esperplugin.md) for Android Studio is available for developers to use, and provides a set of resources to facilitate diagnostics and debugging of applications—whether running in a test lab or deployed in the field.

Esper provides tools that enable Android developers to deliver highly secure solutions to Dedicated Devices, all the while giving them superior flexibility and control over the process. This leads to a better development experience spanning the entire development lifecycle. Furthermore, this lightens the burden on IT, enabling them to focus on more pressing aspects of your product. A [rich API](https://api.esper.io) set and a variety of [open-source SDKs](https://github.com/esper-io/esper-client-py) and tools allow you to incorporate device management for your dedicated device apps and dedicated devices.

## Esper and Android Developers

Esper gives developers the APIs and tools needed to build, deliver, and maintain Dedicated Device applications—all in one place. Esper offers a full suite of APIs and tools enabling Android developers to more efficiently develop, deploy, and support Dedicated Device applications through the entire life cycle.

From the Console you can also perform important activities for working with your apps and devices during the development, test, and scaled deployment phases:

- Defining device templates with standardized provisioning settings specific to a particular app or set of apps.
- Managing your set of apps for development, test, and deployment.
- Including select Play for Work apps using your managed Google Play account.
- Provisioning devices using the Console to prepare them for development and deployment use, as well as manage them ongoing.
- Creating groups of devices to ease the process of targeting sets of devices during development, and ultimately managing a diverse fleet of devices across different apps.
- Setting alerts for specific battery or network conditions on your devices.
- Managing users, including adding additional users to your endpoint for either development or admin use, through the Company Settings.

Many of the above Console features are available via the Esper APIs, so please be sure to check out our API documentation to get started. And install the Esper SDK for Python, our Esper CLI, and the Esper Tools for Android Studio.
