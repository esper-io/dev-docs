Virtual devices are a convenient means to target a device without having the available hardware, or when you do not want to risk breaking the actual hardware device. By trading off the lower performance of a virtual device, you gain a very capable and streamlined virtual device that can hugely boost your productivity during development and early testing.

The Esper Android Tools provide a customized Esper Virtual Device (EVD) image based on the x86 platform allowing you to try out Esper Enhanced Android providing features such as Zero-touch enrollment. You can register your EVD serial number or IMEI number using an Esper Device Template of your choice and then re-start the EVD. On boot the EVD will then get enrolled to your Endpoint automatically and you can start accessing the EVD and take actions using the Esper Console or through our APIs, SDK, and CLI.

Inorder to get the Esper Virtual Device, simply follow the instructions to install [Esper Android Studio Plugin](https://docs.esper.io/home/esperplugin.html) which will automatically install the Virtual Device on your system.
