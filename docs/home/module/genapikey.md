# Generating an API Key
<div class="avg-reading-time">Average reading time : {{ $page.readingTime.text.replace(' read', '') }}</div>


To access Esper APIs, SDK, or CLI an API key is needed. An additional piece of information called `Enterprise ID` is needed for APIs and SDK. You can find your `Enterprise ID` in `Enterprise Settings` tab or top right corner on `Developer Options` tab on your dashboard. 

To generate your API key, follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Go to `Developer Options` on the left panel of your dashboard.
2. Click `Register App` on the top right corner.
3. Enter `App name` and `Description` of your app. Click `Register Application`
4. A pop up will open to generate an access token. Click `Generate token`
5. Copy the token using `Copy` option and keep it safe. In case you lose your token, it cannot be recovered, you can only `Delete` or `Renew` your token.

:::tip
 Note: A maximum of 5 applications can be registered and only one token can be associated with an application.
