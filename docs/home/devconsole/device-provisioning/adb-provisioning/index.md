    5.  Run the [attached script](../imei-or-serial-number-based-provisioning/general-android-users/esper-python-script/index.md) on your Desktop/Laptop with Python.
    6.  This will first download the ADB tools from the Internet.
    7.  Then it will download the Esper DPC from Esper Cloud.
    8.  It will then install the DPC App on the device and assign any required permissions.
