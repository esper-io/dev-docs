7. To delete a serial number from a template, simply follow steps 1 to 4, and click on the trash-can icon to delete a serial number from the template.


All this means that during manufacturing, we will need to get a list of serial numbers for all Kiosks, and the serial number should ideally be listed somewhere on the unit, so that it can be easily identified. Serial numbers can be added in bulk using CSV files.




The user can upload IMEI/Serial numbers with a Csv file in the following way -

![Device Template](../../../assets/OLD_DASHBOARD/imei_real.png)

The csv file containing the IMEI's and serial numbers should adhere to the below conditions-

*   The IMEI numbers and serial numbers can be entered separated by comma in the csv file
*   The IMEI numbers should be valid 15 digits. Serial numbers do not have any validation.
*   File should not be empty
*   The first line and column of the excel file should be exactly- "imei1, imei2, serialnumber"
*   For any line imei1 , imei2 , serial number all the three should not be empty
*   Invalid IMEI will not be accepted. IMEIs are being validated through Luhn's algorithm.
*   There should not be more than 3 values for a row
*   Duplicate IMEIs should not be uploaded.
*   IMEI and serial number should not be switched.
*   If user does not want to add a second IMEI or serial number, they should leave the space blank between the commas

**Examples for csv , where a serial number or an IMEI number could be missing**
