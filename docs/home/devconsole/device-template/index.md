How to use Esper's Device Template.

Device Template is a one stop means for you to quickly provision your device. It lets you create a profile for the device where you may choose the policy, apps, device settings, Device Group, and the wallpapers that you want to be provisioned on the device. Device Templates can be created, saved, and used to provision at a later point.

Steps to create a Device Template:

1.  Click on 'Device Template'.
2.  Click on 'Create Template'.
3.  Enter a name for the Device Template. Click 'Next'.

In the Policy section:

Set default app permissions, Android setting app, system updates, password rules, and turn on the toggle buttons for the settings you wish to enable on your devices. If you wish to have Google Play Store show up on the device, you may turn on the toggle button. You may reset these values to default at any time by clicking 'Reset to Default'.

In order to restrict phone numbers that can make or receive calls to the device, upload a .csv file with the allowed phone numbers separated by commas. All numbers must be preceded by +country code (for example +1 for US):

Click 'Next'.

In the Apps section:

Select 'Kiosk mode' to pin an app during startup or 'Multi application mode' to give users access to the Home screen. Choose the apps that you would like to have installed on your device during provisioning. You may choose from install apps you uploaded via [App Management](../app-management/index.md) or install apps from Google Play Store that you approved via [Play For Work](../play-work/index.md).

*   To add your app, upload APK files on App Management - click on the app from the dropdown, select the version and click on Add:
