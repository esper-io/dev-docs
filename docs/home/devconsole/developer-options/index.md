Turn App and Device Management into Code

Esper is focused on helping Android™ app developers build, deliver, and maintain Dedicated Device applications - whether a restaurant kiosk, retail POS, or logistics hub. We have made our APIs available to Android™ developers worldwide so they can move rote app and device management actions into reusable code. Anyone can use our APIs to build, orchestrate, and integrate elegant solutions based on their business requirements. We do the heavy lifting by taking care of the infrastructure, so app developers can focus on building great solutions rather than being bogged down in app and device management. We help you procure efficient hardware along with the optional secure, optimized Esper Enhanced Android™ and our open source APIs and SDKs. We also offer the Esper Plugin for the Android™ Studio with tools improving the challenging task of app diagnostics - including working with deployed apps running on dedicated devices in the field. Check out [esper.io](http://esper.io) for more information about our rich feature set.

To kick things off, you need to generate an API key that you can tie to a specific application - it is your choice on how you want to manage your API keys. Do this by clicking the "Register App" button. You can also easily copy the Enterprise ID, necessary for API calls, by clicking on the copy icon next to Enterprise ID on top right of this section.

Next, you need to enter a unique app name and description(optional) and click register application.

Click Generate Token. This will generate a unique OAuth-based API key.

You can then copy (or renew if needed) your API key.

The API key and Enterprise ID can be copied from the dashboard as shown above and can be used to access our [CLI platform](https://github.com/esper-io/esper-cli) (https://github.com/esper-io/esper-cli) as well as to use the [SDK/API](http://api.esper.io) (api.esper.io) in your development and management systems.
