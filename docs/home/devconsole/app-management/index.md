Learn about Esper's App Management.

This section enables you to manage your applications. You may add the following type of apps to your device:

1.  Upload Private Apps (APK files) to the Esper Cloud.
2.  Install Google Play Apps after [approving](../device-template/how-approve-google-play-store-app/index.md) them.
3.  Install default Android™ apps.

Upload Private Apps (APK files) to Esper Cloud:

*   You can upload your own mobile app through an APK file using the upload button on the top right hand corner.
*   The uploaded apps will be shown under the 'Uploaded apps' section:

Install Google Play Apps after [approving](../device-template/how-approve-google-play-store-app/index.md) them:

*   You can also allow a user to download apps from Google Play Store.
*   This requires approving a specific app from the Play Store to allow a user to download the app on their device:

*   You also have the option to handle new 'App Permission Requests' for the approved apps. You can:

1.  Approve the requests for new app permissions so that users can update the installed app.
2.  Revoke the requests for new app permissions so that users cannot update the installed apps.

3\. You can set the option to receive email notification whenever an app requests new permissions by adding the appropriate email address or addresses in the notification settings:
